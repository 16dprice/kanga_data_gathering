" 2007. Robin and Ted are running in a airport.
"," Robin: That security guard was a little bit handsy.
"
" Woman: I'm sorry, sir.
"," Robin: His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job? Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do? I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night dreaming about being a... I mean, uh... This is a cool job.
"
" Ted: Thanks.
"," Robin: Your uniforms are pretty.
"
" Ted: That thing better have call waiting.
"," Robin: Could you just call the firm and explain what happened?
"
" Ted: It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today. I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage. I'm so stupid. Why did I have to jump that turnstile?
"," Robin: Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault?
"
" Flashback. A few months earlier Marshall, Lily, Robin and Ted are at Mclaren's.
"," Robin: Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe?
"
" Marshall: On one pull.
"," Robin: Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow.
"
" Barney: Absolutely.
"," Robin: Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers.
"
" Marshall: Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online, see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe.
"," Robin: Ooh, he's starting!
"
" 53 minutes later...
"," Robin: Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive.
"
" End of flashbacks. Back to the airport with Robin and Ted.
"," Robin: See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight.
"
" Ted: What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today.
"," Robin: Well, he never even called you back?
"
" Ted (voix off): It turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me to Chicago on time for my job interview, but it was all the way on the other side of the airport.
"," Robin: What was the name of the airline again?
"
" Ted: I think it was something like Flights R' Us.
"," Robin: Was the ""R"" backwards?
"
" Ted: God, I hope not.
"," Robin: Geez.
"
" Ted: Stupid smart carts. More like dumb carts.
"," Robin: If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault.
"
" Ted: You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.
"," Robin: Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault?
"
" Robin comes in the bathroom behind Marshall.
"," Robin: Marshall? Oh, my God!
"
" Ted: So, yes, it was your fault. I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time! (Ted fells) And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport.
"," Robin: That really wasn't my fault. I wouldn't have walked in on
"
" Flasback. Ted and Robin eat while walking on the street.
"," Robin: Hey, what's going on here?
"
" Ted: Oh, looks like they're camping out for something.
"," Robin: Yeah, but for what?
"
" Ted: I don't know. Usually there's a Stormtrooper or Klingon in line to give you some indication. ""Annual wedding dress blowout. Designer sample dresses up to 90% off. Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m.""
"," Robin: Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks?
"
" Lily: We have to camp out.
"," Robin: Are you serious?
"
" Lily and Robin arrive at the wedding dress shop.
"," Robin: This is the place.
"
" Lily: Oh, wow. Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet! Vera Wang! Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here?
"," Robin: You said wang.
"
" Lily: Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998. Only fewer mullets.
"," Robin: You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York.
"
" On alarm starts beeping.
"," Robin: That's kind of annoying.
"
" Lily: Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute. (5 hours later) I don't think I can take this. Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again, but then it does. Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on?
"," Robin: It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along?
"
" Lily: If we get through this, I swear I'm gonna live my life differently.
"," Robin: I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time.
"
" Lily: It's him. It's the car guy!
"," Robin: Get out of here!
"
" Marshall: Nobody does it better than you.
"," Robin: Marshall?! Oh, my God! (Marshall falls)
"
" End of flashback. At the airport.
"," Robin: So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store, we would have made the first flight.
"
" Man: Oh, my God! You're that reporter from Metro News 1.
"," Robin: Yes, yes, I am. I can't believe you recognized me.
"
" Ted: Robin...
"," Robin:  One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,
"
" Man:  I knew it!
"," Robin: God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight.
"
" Man: I think it might hurt. This is such a nightmare.
"," Robin: Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out for a wedding dress?
"
" Ted: 1939?! This penny's from 1939! (at the bar with Robin) A 67-year-old penny. Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II?
"," Robin: Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting.
"
" Ted: Look, I know a little something about coins, and this baby is worth something to a collector.
"," Robin: No, it's not.
"
" They're on the street.
"," Robin: You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty.
"
" Ted: Hey, that's 150 times its original value. Actually, the meal was only $1.49. 1984.
"," Robin: Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again.
"
" Ted: How dare you.
"," Robin: Hey, what's going on?
"
" Ted: I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something.
"," Robin: Yeah, but for what?
"
" Ted: It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town.
"," Robin: And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there, and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day.
"
" Ted: Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe. Barney wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date...
"," Robin: And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny.
"
" Man: Uh, I'm afraid not. There are no extra seats on the plane. I'm sorry.
"," Robin: All, right, well, thanks for trying.
"
" Ted: I can't believe this. That's it, it's over.
"," Robin: Ted, come on. Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today. Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule.
"
" Barney: Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner.
"," Robin: Or maybe he was. Think about it. The way that she bats her eyelashes and shakes her tail feathers in his face? (chuckles) She wants it.
"
" Ted: No, you... (His phone starts beeping) Hold on. (beep) Hello?
"," Robin: For the love of God, will one of you idiots hang up the phone?
"
" Barney: Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning. (Barney snickers) Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids.
"," Robin:I don't think you know what Spain is.
"
" Ted from 2030: So Marshall walked in the next morning all ready to quit. But then something weird happened. Suddenly, he didn't hate the paperwork. He didn't hate the coffee. He didn't even hate the dirty jokes. Out of nowhere, Marshall actually liked GNB.
"," Robin: It's graduation goggles.
"
" Marshall: What?
"," Robin:Graduation goggles, like with high school. It's four years of bullies making fun of all the kids with braces, even after the braces come off and they can walk just fine. But then, on graduation day, you suddenly get all misty because you realize you're never going to see those jerks again. I just had graduation goggles with that guy Scooby I dated.
"
" Lily: The guy who was basically a dog?
"," Robin:He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful. (as speaking to a dog): He was a good boy.
"
" Barney: Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having s*x with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it.
"," Robin:The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer.
"
" At the Bar
"," Robin:...so, if the Landmarks Preservation Committee sides with Zoey, your whole project goes down the tubes? You must be furious.
"
" Barney: I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.
"," Robin: Hershel?
"
" Barney: That's how I'm gonna use mine.
"," Robin: Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?
"
" Barney: Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better.
"," Robin:Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?
"
" Barney: Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time.
"," Robin: (Robin is standing at the door) Oh, my God!
"
" Barney: How long have you been there?
"," Robin: You don't remember?
"
" [FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.
"
" Barney: Oh, no, I'm fine.
"," Robin: Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?
"
" Barney:Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?
"," Robin: Yeah.
"
" Barney: There's nothing to talk about.
"," Robin: You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.
"
" Barney: I don't want to talk about it, okay?
"," Robin: Why not?
"
" Barney: Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.
"," Robin: I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... (quietly): ticking.
"
" Barney: That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?
"," Robin: No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.
"
" Barney: Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.
"," Robin: Huh?
"
" Barney:...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted. (quiet sobbing) You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?
"," Robin: What is wrong with you?
"
" Marshall, Barney, Robin and Ted are in McClaren's.
"," Robin: ""What a nice surprise""? No, a nice surprise would have been a safe falls from 40 stories e crushes them both. You let yourself do?
"
" Ted: We had a friendly discussion and we resumed our respective paths.
"," Robin: You're f*cked up. He f*cked up, right?
"
" Marshall: Well done.
"," Robin: What?
"
" Marshall: It's a very big check.
"," Robin: So big, that when you sit next to on the plane, you wonder if the check would not have had to buy two seats.
"
" Marshall: It's all in the assessment of your enemy. I knew he loved the sausages because he was out of breath just by coming to my car and he had mustard on his holster.
"," Robin: Handling a police officer with your sausage. It's sexy.
"
" Barney: $ 375! And he kept the gift certificate. Emilio and I'll call him tell him to shorten the crotch.
"," Robin: You're wrong about that, man.
"
" Marshall: Are you kidding? Robin is a pretty girl. They have no fines. I bet she was often stopped and has never had.
"," Robin: This is outrageous! And relevant.
"
" Policeman: Permits and... Sweetie. No, do not cry. OK, not fine for you. Drive slower next time, OK?
"," Robin: Thank you.
"
" He gets up and leaves the bar when Ted arrived.
"," Robin: How was your lunch with the rich? It started well.
"
" End flashback
"," Robin: Ted, it looks like this guy asks you to design...
"
" Ted: A deadly house.
"," Robin: That's it. A house of horror.
"
" End flashback
"," Robin: You can not do this house!
"
" Stella: He said it was because of what you said.
"," Robin: You did break Tony and Stella? Really sorry, but I must insist that you topes there.
"
" Ted: Let's talk in the hallway.
"," Robin: I'll wait.
"
" Barney, Marshall and Robin were at the bar.
"," Robin: False. This has never happened.
"
" Barney: When will you understand the difference between my life and a porno is that my life has better lighting.
"," Robin: You're lying.
"
" Marshall: Guys, it's 3:00 in the morning and it reeks in here.
"," Robin: Ted said it was okay.
"
" Marshall: Man, life is gonna be sweet!
"," Robin: Oh my god lily, have you seen this kitchen?
"
" Lily: I know. It's... Isn't it amazing?
"," Robin: What the hell are you doing? You can't buy this place; lily you have a debt of the size of Mount Waddington!
"
" Lily: Waddington?
"," Robin: It's the tallest mountain in Canada. It's like 4000 meters high.
"
" Lily: meters?
"," Robin: Ro, don't let Marshall fall in love with this apartment.
"
" Lily: I know, i know, i know, i know! But what do i tell him?
"," Robin: I-I don't know, tell him, tell him you saw a ghost. Tell him it's haunted.
"
" Lily (to Robin): I know what you're thinking. I should tell Marshall the truth. I've got the whole thing figure out. We'll apply for the loan under Marshall's name, and he'll never need to know. And then in the meantime, i'll slowly work down my debt, right after i furnish the apartment. I saw this amazing leather sofa today.
"," Robin: you should be a reality show.
"
" [The appartment - Ted/Barney/Robin - they come in]
"," Robin: Okay, let me get this straight. You just snuck this girl into some stranger's apartment?
"
" Barney: Works at every time.
"," Robin: Wait. That time that you offered to walk my dogs when i went to visit my dad in Vancouver...
"
" (Ted looks worried)
"," Robin: Wh-what?
"
" Ted: There was a fight here.
"," Robin: What do you mean?
"
" Ted: Whenever Marshall and Lily have a big argument, they always leave a trail of evidence all over the apartment.
"," Robin: Oh, God here we go. He had a detective club as a kid.
"
" Ted: HUm the Mosby boys cracked a lot of big cases.
"," Robin: The Mosby boys? You mean you and your sister.
"
" Ted: We solved the mystery of the missing retainer.
"," Robin: Let me guess, it was in the garbage.
"
" Ted: Why are you like this? Anyway, this is serious. I know Lily and Marshall. All the tell tale signs are here. Like this
"," Robin: A water bott.
"
" Ted: Just as i suspected, Cherry Garcia. Given the liquid consistency, i place the fight between... noon and 1.
"," Robin: Ew, that was on the floor.
"
" Ted: Marshall stood here. Eating and yelling, yelling and eating. Lily stood here. Crying. (Ted takes a handkerchief on the bar of the kitchen)
"," Robin: Hey, Ted!
"
" He had to get out of here, any way he could. He choose the door slamming it behind him.
"," Robin: Which Is why this picture is crooked.
"
" Ted: Now that we need is a motive. The million dollar question what were they fighting about?
"," Robin: I know what they've been fighting...
"
" Ted: Lily left the lid off... (Ted put dark sunglasses) and marshall blew heads.
"," Robin: I know what they were fighting about, and it wasn't peanut butter.
"
" Barney (to Robin): Just...
"," Robin: They were fighting because they didn't get the loan and it's all Lily's fault.
"
" Ted: What?
"," Robin: Yeah, she has a pile of debt the size of mount... Rushmore
"
" Ted: Not Lily and Marshall, no way.
"," Robin: Well, it's been nice knowing you guys.
"
" Ted: What do you mean?
"," Robin: Well, Marshall's gonna get yyou guys, Lily's gonna get me.
"
" Ted: Even if they break up, that doesn't mean we can't all hangout. I mean we broke up and we still hang out. It's not weird.
"," Robin: It's a little weird.
"
" (keys noise)
"," Robin: They're back.
"
" [End flashback]
"," Robin: So you're not getting a divorce?
"
" Barney: Oh, thank God. Cause, i mean, if you did then who'd be the lame married couple i get to make fun of? Like 'Hey Marshall, you're married mrs right, you just didn't know her first name was Always.' That stuff is cold.
"," Robin: So what's the annoucement?
"
" Robin joins Lily at a chiroposdist's place.
"," Robin: We had our first fight.
"
" Chiroposdist's place.
"," Robin: It's this big skyscraper in Spokane. It'd be a huge project for his firm.
"
" Chiropodist's place.
"," Robin: So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company.
"
" Lily: So you and Ted had your first fight. It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me.
"," Robin: Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm.
"
" Lily: Ooh, two tragedies in one day.
"," Robin: The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done.
"
" Ted: Hey.
"," Robin: Hey.
"
" Ted: How was your day?
"," Robin: Good.
"
" Ted: Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was?
"," Robin: No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight?
"
" Ted: You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time.
"," Robin: Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter.
"
" Lily: Robin!
"," Robin: What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster.
"
" Lily: You should work at a suicide hotline.
"," Robin: And then it got ugly.
"
" [FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like Die Hard. But Field of Dreams? Once is more than enough.
"
" Ted: So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is Field of Dreams?
"," Robin: It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid.
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie.
"
" Lily: Listening is the foundation of a relationship. And if he's really droning on, you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards. You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI.
"," Robin: I guess I don't know how to do that.
"
" Lily: Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober. That's what I tried to explain to the cop.
"," Robin: No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?
"
" Later, Robin and Lily arrive at MacLaren's.
"," Robin: Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?
"
" Lily: Thanks.
"," Robin: I wonder where Ted went.
"
" A girl: Ted Mosby, the architect?
"," Robin: Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier.
"
" Lily: He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay?
"," Robin: Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part.
"
" Lily: What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out.
"," Robin: I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat.
"
" Girl: She's a kickboxing instructor. Her ass looks better than my face.
"," Robin: All right, we'll swing by the party.
"
" At the party.
"," Robin: Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers.
"
" Guy 2: Yo, what's up, ladies? Welcome to the party. Yeah! Just need you to sign this release protecting the host from any and all responsibility should you harm yourself or a third party. Then freakin' rage! Yeah!
"," Robin: Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted.
"
" Lily: See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup. Why? Because I listened to him. It was a strong and nurturing relationship that I threw away like old gum.
"," Robin: Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her?
"
" Guy 2: The girl with the smackable ass.
"," Robin: Yes, that's the young lady.
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing. Ted hates clubs.
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to s*x.
"
" Lily: Did you grow up in that Footloose town?
"," Robin: I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories.
"
" Lily: Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine.
"," Robin: He's not answering. Calling Marshall.
"
" Marshall: Hello.
"," Robin: Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted?
"
" Marshall: Oh, Robin, hi. Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. He's, uh... he's working.
"," Robin: Uh, okay. Bye. (She hangs up) Marshall just lied. Ted's cheating on me.
"
" In front of a club.
"," Robin: Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier. One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair. And the other's a cheating b*st*rd.
"
" Lily: Then can I have the...? That's cool. You keep that.
"," Robin: So these guys... One of them's an architect.
"
" Bouncer: Ted Mosby, the architect?
"," Robin: That's the one.
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: You know this girl. Where does she live?
"
" Lily: Well, I'm out of money.
"," Robin: I'm cashed, too.
"
" Bouncer: I'll take your purse.
"," Robin: My purse?
"
" Bouncer: Yeah, my girl likes clutches.
"," Robin: Okay, fine.
"
" Lily: You should tell her that looks really good with a chocolate boot.
"," Robin: Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse. No room for my gun. Here. Now where does the rodeo slut live?
"
" Lily: Oh, my God, Robin, are you going to kick this girl's ass?
"," Robin: Yeah... And steal her purse.
"
" In a building.
"," Robin: I can't believe he's cheating on me. You know how many times I could have cheated? Six... no seven. And you know two of them, and they would surprise you.
"
" Lily: 3-C, let's do this. You ready?
"," Robin: Should I just kick the door in?
"
" Lily: Those are really nice heels and you already lost the purse. Let's see if it's unlocked. It's unlocked. Okay, get in there and kick some spankable ass. Robin?
"," Robin: I'm the problem.
"
" Lily: What?
"," Robin: You were right. I don't know how to be a girlfriend. I took the nicest guy in the world and I made him a cheater.
"
" Lily: Well, don't stand out here and beat yourself up. Get in there and beat Ted up. I'll handle the slutty kickboxer. Actually, I'll take Ted.
"," Robin: Let's do this.
"
" Lily: Bring it. (They come in)
"," Robin: What do you think you're...? Barney?
"
" Barney (tied up to the bed): Thank God you're here. Can you help with this? I need nails.
"," Robin: Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?
"
" Barney: Ted? He's at work.
"," Robin: How did you get here?
"
" Barney: And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here.
"," Robin: But why would you use Ted's name?
"
" Lily: Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.
"," Robin: Everything isn't okay. Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid.
"
" Lily: This is how people act in relationships.
"," Robin: And that's why I avoid relationships.
"
" Barney: And thus ended this chapter of, ""Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand."" Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower.
"," Robin: You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?
"
" Ted's office.
"," Robin: Hey.
"
" Ted: Hey. What are you doing here?
"," Robin: I brought donuts. And I don't want to brag, but they're filled with jelly.
"
" Ted: Thanks. So, uh... how was your night?
"," Robin: It was... fine. Nothing exciting. How was yours?
"
" Ted: You really want to hear about boring architect stuff?
"," Robin: Yes, I do. I'm sorry about earlier. To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of Field of Dreams. I fell asleep half way through.
"
" Ted: What? The best part's the last 20 minutes.
"," Robin: Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause... You know what, um... What I'm trying to say is... I love being the person you bitch to. So how was your day, Mr. Architect?
"
" Ted: Oh, I like the way you say that. Hey, you want to see the building that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate?
"," Robin: Obviously. Wow.
"
" Ted: Yes.

"," Robin: Oh, my God, I can't wait to see this movie. I hear it's really scary.
"
" (Lily and Robin are in the Kitchen)
"," Robin: They don't know what it is. It just showed up on my mom's X-ray.
"
" Barney: I know. Isn't it?
"," Robin: Why are you wearing that?
"
" Barney: Exactly. Science. There is an 83% correlation between the times men wear boutonnieres and the times they get laid. Think about it. Proms, weddings. Grandmas' funerals. Thanks for the redhead, Nana. The ""everyday boutonniere"" by Stinson.
"," Robin: And nope. I'm sorry, Barney, but no girl is going home with a guy with a flower on his chest. Unless he's a clown, and she's in the trunk of his car.
"
" Barney: Robin, did you know that boutonniere is French for ""bootie is near?"" True story. Une histoire vraie.
"," Robin: Hmm! Did you know that Barney is French for ""sad little guy who works way too hard to get laid""""
"
" Barney: Woman, you best check yourself.
"," Robin: Yeah, on the bright side, I guess suits are pretty boring without them, so...
"
" Barney: Madam... that is an insult that cannot be borne! I demand satisfaction!
"," Robin: What, are we gonna duel?
"
" Lily: Hey, Robin, do you want to go get a Korean massage on Saturday?
"," Robin: Oh, I'd love to. I've got this knot in my neck that's so annoying.
"
" Barney: Space Teens?! Is this a porno?
"," Robin: No, no. Dude, dude. Sweet! It's a kids' show.
"
" Barney: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big old bowl of pornflakes. Whoa! And who is this exquisite keytarist I assum you're about to make sweet love to?
"," Robin: Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life.
"
" Barney: Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers? Get mad at each other and wrestle, but then end up kissing in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily.
"," Robin: Barney, you know what? If you're going to be disgusting, we're not watching this, okay?
"
" Lily: Yeah. Come on, Barney. It's just a cute little story about... What exactly is this about?
"," Robin: Oh, two average Canadian teenagers who solve crimes in space using math.
"
" Lily: Oh. Oh. I have to say, as much as I hate to agree with Barney, this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia.
"," Robin: Okay, guys, come on. It's a kids' show! Like Electric Company or Sesame Street or, um...
"
" Marshall: You can't do that on television.
"," Robin: Exactly.
"
" Ted: Robin, this show is so dirty, I don't know whether to hug you or run a shower for you so you can sit there alone, crying and clenching your knees.
"," Robin: It's just bad camera work, okay? Wayne, our camera guy... he wasn't that great.
"
" Marshall: I don't know. I think he did a pretty good job, considering he was probably only using one hand.
"," Robin: You know what? I feel bad for you Americans, that you can look at this wondrous and educational adventure through space, and see something obscene. Can you just please try to look at this with the innocence of a child?
"
" Lily: Hey, if you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her?
"," Robin: Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card from her every year, but we're not really friends anymore.
"
" Lily: I don't get it. How can you and Glitter just stop being friends? Best friends don't do that.
"," Robin: Well, we did, okay? And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it. I got to go.
"
" Ted's appartment
"," Robin: No.
"
" Ted: We've been waiting all day!
"," Robin: Just watch it without me.
"
" Barney: Two dudes on the couch together watching p0rn? That's kind of weird.
"," Robin: Okay, it's not p0rn, it's a kids' show.
"
" Ted: Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse.
"," Robin: Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off.

"
" Lily: Crib...
"," Robin: What's the matter? You look rattled.
"
" Lily: Rattled? I want to talk about babies.
"," Robin: What?
"
" Lily: Look, I know you don't care about this stuff, but I'm about to become a mother. And as a future mother, I'm gonna need the support...
"," Robin: Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet.
"
" Lily: What's that supposed to mean?
"," Robin: It means that a fertilized egg has not yet attached itself to the lining of your uterine wall. You see? I read your Facebook updates. God, it's like it's all you ever talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it!
"
" Lily: Well, guess what? I've got some good news. When that baby comes, you don't have to see it. In fact, you don't have to see me. This whole friendship thing? Done.
"," Robin: Great.
"
" Lily: Oh, there you are. Robin, I owe you a huge apology.
"," Robin: No, okay? Me first. I've been pulling away from you, and I'm sorry. It's just, the last time my best friend had a baby...

"
" Ted: Robin, how can I possibly live up to that review?
"," Robin: What? You know what you're doing down there. Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it. We know this.
"
" Ted: But that is not the point. I mean, you broke the first rule of setting people up: undersell. It's like, if someone's never seen The Karate Kid, you don't say, ""It's the greatest movie ever."" You say, ""Uh, it's pretty good"" And then they see it, it blows their freakin' mind. Because Cobra Kai sensei's all like, ""Sweep the leg!"" And Daniel-san's all like...

"
" Ted: How?
"," Robin: I sent her another email. ""Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound like I was trying to oversell Ted. The truth is, he is a genuinely nice, down to earth guy, and I think you two would really hit it off.""
"
" Ted: Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect. That totally takes the pressure...
"," Robin: ""Is he going to rock your world in bed? No. But he's clean, open to criticism, and not into anything too weird. He's not bad at all. Not bad at all.""
"
" Ted: See, now you went too far in the other...
"," Robin: ""I'll be honest. The first few times aren't going to be that great. He's going to say 'Are you finished?' more times than a waiter in a busy restaurant.""
"
" Ted: ""Ted Mosby is solid as a rock."" No. ""Dependable."" No. ""Rugged."" No.
"," Robin: Why don't I just go to the Chevy Web site and copy down adjectives?
"
" Ted: I just want to hit that perfect middle ground.
"," Robin: How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out? ""Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, and really rich, but lacks bladder control."" Oh, damn.
"
" Ted: What?
"," Robin: That last bump just made me hit send.
"
" Ted: Oh, no.
"," Robin: Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke.

"," Robin: Weird day.
"
" (phone chirps)
"," Robin: Hey, look at that! Liz still wants to meet you. That's great!
"
" Ted: I guess. Wait a minute. You said Liz was a total ten. Why would she want to meet the incontinent freak show you described? You oversold her!
"," Robin: Maybe a little.
"
" Ted: You said she was a ten.
"," Robin: I did not specify on what scale.
"
" Ted: You said she looked like a movie star.
"," Robin: She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear.

"," Robin: Oh, thanks, but I don't actually cry in front of people, or cry at all for that matter. Man, it's gross. Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?
"
" Lily: Because you have feelings for Ted.
"," Robin: I don't know, maybe.
"
" Lily: OK, what is wrong with the two of you?! Seriously. He likes you and you like him, just, just, just be together. Geez, Louise, happiness is not that difficult.
"," Robin: Oh, look, OK. Yes, I cried in the bathroom, and that was weird. But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy. The fact is I don't know how I feel.
"
" Lily: Yes you do. Seeing him with someone else and crying about it. Guess what? That's how you feel. That is nothing but how you feel.
"," Robin: OK, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy? Lily: Kinda, yeah.
"
" Robin: OK, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy? Lily: Kinda, yeah.
"," Robin: But it doesn't change anything. I still don't wanna get married and he's still... Ted. What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he could be happy.

" Ted: Which could be a stepping stone to bigger things in your career.

"," Robin: Well, there's only one possible way to avoid getting deported. My lawyer said I could become an American citizen.
"
" Barney: Perfect. Problem solved. Welcome aboard.
"," Robin: Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am.
"
" Barney: I know, and it's provided us with a lot of laughs. But, Robin, if you want to live here, work here and throw chairs at people here, you have to do this.

"
" Barney: Ready for the test maybe, but ready to be an American? Not on your sweet life. For you to be an American, we got to get the Canadian out of you. That's why I've created these questions. Question one: ""Who is this?""
"," Robin: Queen Elizabeth II.
"
" Barney: No, the answer is Elton John. Question two: ""What the hell is this?""
"," Robin: Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played...
"
" Ted (2030): And by the end of the night, Barney had turned Robin into a real American.

"
" Barney: Archie Bunker's neighbor was George Jefferson.
"," Robin: Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now!
"
" Barney: All right, hold your horses. Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie and the childhood obesity it leads to- who is this?
"," Robin: That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the ""Hey, Vern"" guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy.
"
" Barney: Jeff Foxworthy? No, it's Jim Varney. You're kidding me. You don't know that?

" Robin walks on the street.
"," Robin: Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all. (She throws one bottle on the floor) Maybe I'll rob a liquor store. Maybe I won't. My choice. Learn English! The Hoser Hut. I could duck in for a drink. No, no, that life's behind me. Forget it. Well, I could in for just one beer. What's the harm in that? It's a free country. (She crosses the road and enter into the bar) *O Canada Our home and native land...* Oh, God, I miss it. *True patriots love...*

" Barney: You went Canadian.
"," Robin: How Canadian?
"
" Barney: This Canadian. (He opens the curtains) Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky- you're in Toronto.
"," Robin: Oh, God. Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut... And I met this women's curling team.
"
" Flash-back
"," Robin: We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams/Rich title double bill in Toronto.
"
" End of flash-back
"," Robin: How did you find me, anyway?
"
" Barney: You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic...
"," Robin: Canada isn't across the Atlantic.
"
" Barney: You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours.
"," Robin: Barney, I'm not taking the test.
"
" Barney: God, you're still drunk.
"," Robin: Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be.
"
" Barney: It's like an entire country without a tailor.
"," Robin: Yeah, give me two coffees.
"
" Women: $3,50, please. Hey, what did you think of the game last night?
"," Robin: What game?
"
" Women: The Leafs beat Edmonton. Beauchemin went five hole in OT.
"," Robin: Oh, I guess I missed it.
"
" Women: Oh, sorry. You're American. Here's your change.
"," Robin: I'm not American.
"
" Barney: What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.
"," Robin: Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either.
"
" Barney: Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back.
"," Robin: When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country.
"
" Barney: Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday.
"," Robin: Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, ""Yeah, America's cool.""
"
" Barney: Hmm.
"," Robin: And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, ""Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too."" I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian.
"
" Barney: Wait, you can do that?
"," Robin: Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two.
"
" Barney: I see.
"," Robin: You understand?
"
" No. Then what we're saying is she's a crazy stalker bitch who pulled that fire alarm and you should run screaming.
"," Robin: You know what?
"
" Fine. Forgotten.

I'll tell you something though, if a woman-not you... just some hypothetical woman-were to bare with me through all this. I think I'd make a damn good husband.

" Barney: Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity!
"," Robin: You can't call shotgun for eternity.
"
" Barney: I just called it.
"," Robin: You can't just call things, barney.
"
" Lily: Oh, baby, it's just not fair. You've been working so hard. Late nights, weekends. I never see you. We've barely made love in weeks. It's bad, guys, mama needs her sugar.
"," Robin: Look, Marshall, he screamed at you, you took it. He probably respects you more for it.
"
" Marshall: I don't know what happened. There's just something about being yelled at like that, like I was being scolded by my dad. Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.
"," Robin: Is ""boy"" the right word?
"
" Marshall: How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?
"," Robin: Here's what I would do if I were you.

" [ROBIN'S SCENARIO]
"," Robin: Hi, Arthur.
"
" Arthur: Hello, Marshall. Have you finally finished the ninja report?
"," Robin: Yeah, I got it. Right here. I think it's gonna blow you away.
"
" Arthur: Please, I have a family.
"," Robin: So we good?
"
" Arthur: We're so good.
"," Robin: Then why are you still in my office?
"
" Lily: And I don't scream at my kids, none of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.
"," Robin: So it's not a circle.
"
" (Robin climbs in)
"," Robin: Hey, I was just heading to the bar. What are you guys doing out here?
"
" Marshall: Oh, I was just telling Ted a story.
"," Robin: Ooh, I like stories. You want a lick? What?
"
" Ted: Is that ice cream cone big enough?
"," Robin: Uh, it's delicious enough.
"
" Barney: Hey, what are you guys doing out here?
"," Robin: Oh sweet, can I get a toot?
"
" Barney: Oh, Marshall, switch seats with me. I called shotgun for all eternity.
"," Robin:You can't call shotgun for eternity.
"
" Barney: Well, that's funny, cause I did!
"," Robin:It's case by case.
"
" Barney: Trust that impulse, Ted.
"," Robin: Hey. Something kind of cool just happened. My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award.
"
" Lily: A... LAME-A?
"," Robin: We prefer Local Area Media Award. Um... there's going to be this big banquet. I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came. And there's an open bar.
"
" Ted: Yeah, put me down for two.
"," Robin: Really? It's three months away.
"
" At the appartment
"," Robin: So should I wear my hair up or down? Lily.
"
" Lily: What?
"," Robin: You okay?
"
" Lily: Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm just exhausted from work. The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day. It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap.
"," Robin: Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were? Is that safe?
"
" Lily: Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me?
"," Robin: Ted's still coming to this thing, right?
"
" Lily: Yep.
"," Robin: Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?
"
" Lily: Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous.
"," Robin: No, it's just this guy at the station. I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes. Is it going to be weird?
"
" Ted: Hey.
"," Robin: Hi.
"
" Ted: You look nice.
"," Robin: Oh, um, Ted, this is Sandy.
"
" Lily: Exactly. Thank you, Mary.
"," Robin: So, Mary, what do you do for a living?
"
" Mary: Yes, I'm a paralegal.
"," Robin: Oh, so, Mary the paralegal. What does a paralegal do exactly?
"
" Ted: You're welcome.
"," Robin: Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him. Don't let him out of your sight for a minute.
"
" Ted: Hey.
"," Robin: Hey. Mary seems nice. Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?
"
" Ted: I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened.
"," Robin: And just like that, it's all okay. Roll credits.
"
" Ted: So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now?
"," Robin: We're still friends.
"
" Ted: Are we? You don't return my calls, we never hang out and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?
"," Robin: Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?
"
" Ted: Oh, so now she's a whore?
"," Robin: What?
"
" Vampire Lou: Scooter ""Bam-Bam"" Branson for A Bicycle-- Joyride or Deathtrap? Mike Murphy for 13, Pregnant and Addicted. And Robin Scherbotsky for Pickles, the Singing Dog. And the winner is... Robin Scherbotsky.

"
" Marshall: Congratulations.
"," Robin: Oh, thanks. Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab?
"
" Ted: Yeah. Thanks. Well... Good night.
"," Robin: Good night.
"
" Marshall: Wow, so they're...? Robin, where's Sandy Rivers?
"," Robin: I put him in a cab.
"
" Barney: So you and he aren't...?
"," Robin: I don't date people I work with. I was just trying to make Ted jealous. Is he...?
"
" Marshall: He's off trying to make you jealous.
"," Robin: Oh, well, good for them. And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool.
"
" Lily, waking up: Mary's a prostitute?
"," Robin: What?!
"
" Marshall: We were having a conversation about prostitution, and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar and now she and Ted are upstairs.
"," Robin: Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately? Is he having a nervous breakdown?
"
" Ted: I think I'm in love with you.
"," Robin: What?!
"
" Flashback. Ted, Robin and Barney are at the apartment.
"," Robin: Spider! Spider!
"
" Ted: Where?
"," Robin: Right there.
"
" Robin is sick and in bed:
"," Robin: Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick.

"," Robin: Good night.
"
" Ted: Good night.
"," Robin: Wait, Ted?
"
" Ted: Yeah?
"," Robin: Good night.
"
" The next morning, Ted walks into Robin's apartment. Robin's on the phone.
"," Robin: Well, great, I'll see you then. Bye, sweetie. (To Ted) Hey. Guess what? My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend. She gets in on Thursday.
"
" Ted: That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.
"," Robin: Really? You'd do that?
"
" Flashback. At Ted's apartment.
"," Robin: Ted.
"
" Ted: Yeah?
"," Robin: Falafel.
"
" Lily: Falafel?
"," Robin: Falafel.
"
" Lily: Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said ""falafel""?
"," Robin: I totally choked.
"
" Lily: I just don't get it. Why can't you tell Ted you love him?
"," Robin: Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.
"
" Lily: Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before. No.
"," Robin: Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit.
"
" Barney: No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have s*x, you exit when she's in the shower.
"," Robin: So every girl you have s*x with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that.
"
" End of flashback. Back with Robin and Lily.
"," Robin: So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit.
"
" Lily: Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall.
"," Robin: It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.
"
" Lily: Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing.
"," Robin: Oh, here comes Katie.
"
" Lily: Aw, your sister's so cute.
"," Robin: Yeah. This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school, with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack.
"
" Lily: Hello, Kitty.
"," Robin: Oh, no. No. No. No.
"
" Katie: Hey, Robin. How are you?
"," Robin: Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person?
"
" Kyle: Looks like hotness runs in the family.
"," Robin: Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...?
"
" Kyle: My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad, but he buys me beer, so...
"," Robin: That's cool. This is my friend Lily.
"
" Kyle: Hot.
"," Robin: You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled.
"
" Katie: Um, actually, I'm going to stay with Kyle tonight.
"," Robin: Uh, no, you're not.
"
" Katie: Oh, come on. It's kind of a special night. If you know what I mean.
"," Robin: What? Oh. Oh...
"
" Barney: Discouraging premarital s*x is against my religion.
"," Robin: Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.
"
" Lily: It's 2:00 and you've already had three scotch and sodas.
"," Robin: That's why I need your help.
"
" fact number one: When construction began on March 17, 1930, the framework rose at a rate of four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. There it is. There it is. Come on. These are fun facts, guys, let's have fun with them.
"," Robin: You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special.
"
" Katie: You told them?
"," Robin: Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?
"
" Barney: s*x is fun.
"," Robin: See?
"
" Katie: You are such a hypocrite. You were only 16 when you lost yours.
"," Robin: Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room.
"
" Katie: Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now. It's like forever. I mean, we've already done everything else. I mean, we've even...
"," Robin: Oh. La, la, la, la, la.La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la, la, la, la.
"
" Katie: You have no right to tell me not to do it.
"," Robin: But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted.
"
" Katie: Robin, this is happening. Look, I already put it up on my Myspace page. I need a clove.
"," Robin: You smoke now, too?
"
" Marshall: No!
"," Robin: No ""Aw, remember cloves?"" This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having s*x.
"
" Barney: This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer.
"," Robin: What did you teach?
"
" Lily: Oh, yeah, that sounds so good. Oh, I love you, Marshall. I'm so glad we're waiting. (12 minutes later): Oops. End of flashback.
"," Robin: Oh, that's adorable.
"
" Lily: The point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.
"," Robin: Well, mine was terrible.
"
" Lily: Wait, I've never heard your story.
"," Robin: Well, as you know, I was 16. And it was with my boyfriend Brian.
"
" Brian: Ready?
"," Robin: Yeah.
"
" Brian: This feels so right.
"," Robin: Oh, I know.
"
" Brian: Oh, Robin.
"," Robin: Oh, Brian.
"
" Lily: I'm so sorry.
"," Robin: Eh, I should've known. There were signs.
"
" Brian: Oh, my God! My mom's home. Quick! Get under my bed.
"," Robin: What?! Oh, my God!
"
" End of flashback.
"," Robin: You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had s*x, it counts.
"
" Lily: What do you mean just barely?
"," Robin: Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end.
"
" Lily:  Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count.
"," Robin: Yes, it does.
"
" Katie: I'm going to see Kyle.
"," Robin: Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once. You should only be having s*x with someone who's special.
"
" Katie: Oh, please, you've had s*x with, like, a hundred guys.
"," Robin: It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys.
"
" Katie: I'm sure you were madly in love with all of them.
"," Robin: I had different levels of feeling for each of the... very reasonable number of guys.
"
" Katie: Really. Well, do you love Ted? Do you love Ted?
"," Robin: I, um...
"
" Ted: Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 22: The Empire State Building has tons of places where people can have private conversations. ( goes away with Robin) You're off the hook, okay?
"," Robin: Just let me explain.
"
" Ted: You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine.
"," Robin: Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying... ""hm hm hm"" is like... getting into the carpool lane. And I don't want to take an exit, but... at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane. Because what's in the carpool lane? Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get...
"
" Ted: Okay, Robin, Robin, stop. It's no big deal, you don't have to say it.
"," Robin: It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.
"
" Ted: What, you mean like I did?
"," Robin: No. I didn't... Yeah, like you did. I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird.
"
" Ted: Weird... or courageous?
"," Robin: Pretty sure weird. I mean, who gives it up on the first date?
"
" Ted: Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight.
"," Robin: No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut.
"
" Ted: Well, then you're an I-love-you prude. You know what? I take mine back.
"," Robin: You... What?
"
" Ted: I take my ""I love you"" back.
"," Robin: You can't take it back.
"
" Man: You're right. Why would I throw that all away? I'm having the best day!
"," Robin: Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place to lecture you on romantic relationships, but... but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made.
"
" Katie: Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay.
"," Robin: That's not what I meant. I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up. Please don't do this.
"
" Ted is sitting on the couch at the apartment when Robin comes in.
"," Robin: Hey.
"
" Ted: Hey.
"," Robin: She didn't do it.
"
" Ted: Hey, that's great! You got through to her.
"," Robin: No, I didn't. You did. She told me that you talked to her.
"
" Katie: So I told Kyle I wanted to wait... and he dumped me.
"," Robin: Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Aw, honey. I promise everything is gonna be okay. You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo?
"
" Katie: Only if you put a buttload of Kahlua in it.
"," Robin: Don't tell Mom.
"
" End of flashbacks. Back to robin and Ted.
"," Robin: Thanks for doing that.
"
" Ted: You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you.
"," Robin: But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you.
"
" Ted: But she didn't.
"," Robin: Oh, come here. I love you. I said it. Feels right. I love you.
"
" Ted: I'm gay. I'm kidding. I love you, too. Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity.
"," Robin: Yeah. I guess I was just waiting for the right guy.
"
" (Robin walks up with Gael)
"," Robin: Hey, guys. I just got in last night. Um, uh, this is Gael.
"
" Marshall: Girl?
"," Robin: It's pronounced ""guy-el"".
"
" Narrator:...Robin pulled me aside to check in. Now, I'm sure, she meant the best, but she said the worst.
"," Robin: I just want to make sure you're okay with this.
"
" Lily: I do not! Shut up! Oh, my God!
"," Robin: I just hope Ted's okay.
"
" Gael: Hello, Ted. Robin and I are about to make fantastic aquatic s*x on this windsurfing board.
"," Robin: And I just want to make sure you're okay with this. (Both laugh) Okay, how do we do this?
"
" Gael: I think your leg goes up, up...
"," Robin: Okay, how 'bout if I, um...
"
" [The hallway outside Robin's Apartment - Ted/Robin]Ted: All right, first of all, this isn't one of those, ""I came all the way over here because I want you back"" things. There'll be no startling confession of love, no sweet indie rock song that swells up just as we're about to kiss, none of that crap. Got it?
"," Robin: Okay.
"
" Ted: Good. Now, here's the thing. It sucks that you came back from Argentina with someone as awesome as Gael. And I know I have no right to be upset at you. We're broken up, life goes on, whatever. But you know what? We-we never did this. We-we had this polite breakup with no irrational yelling and that's just wrong. So I'm gonna yell irrationally for a while and you're just gonna have to stand there and deal with it, okay?
"," Robin: If you feel like you need to do that, then...
"
" Ted: (yells) I think I do! I really think I do! So now, I'm yelling!
"," Robin: You shaved.
"
" Ted: (yells) I did.
"," Robin: I like the beard.
"
" Ted: (still yelling) I liked it too, but it was getting kind of hot. Maybe in the winter, I'll grow it back out! (quietly) Okay, I'm done.
"," Robin: I know it was weird showing up with Gael. I'm sorry.
"
" Ted: Look, us breaking up, it was the right thing. But it took some time to get over you, you know? I-I'm still getting over you. But you, you were over it the minute they started the in-flight movie.
"," Robin: Over it? My first three days in Argentina, I cried my eyes out. I missed you so much. I wanted to go and prove how adventurous I am, but the truth is, it was really lonely. And that's why Gael happened.
"
" Ted: You weren't trying to win the break-up?
"," Robin: I was trying to survive it.
"
" Ted: Okay. No. See, look, that all sounds good, and we'll still be friends and move on, but..., did he have to be so hot? The guy's an Adonis.
"," Robin: He's not an Adonis.
"
" Ted: He's the Cadillac of rebound guys. Marshall has a crush on him. The guy's perfect.
"," Robin: He's not perfect.
"
" Ted: Oh, come on. He's hot, he windsurfs, he massages things. Name one way I'm better than that guy.
"," Robin: ""You're bigger"".
"
" Ted: Don't patronize me. If anything, he may even be a little bit taller.
"," Robin: No, Ted... ""you're bigger"".
"
" I have now told you everything.
"," Robin: All gone.
"
" At the Bar
"," Robin: No... Hmm. What could she mean when she says 'no'? I don't know, it is totally cryptic.
"
" Ted: So we got off to a rocky start. That may be a problem for some guys, but I get better over time. Right? I'm not some Top 40 song... easily digestible. I'm complex. I require time and multiple listens. I'm 'Stairway to Heaven'.
"," Robin: Wow, Roger Daltrey just rolled over in his grave. That's not the right guy, is it? He's not even dead, is he?
"
" Barney: Is this lame?
"," Robin: Oh, Barney, no, no. We said no fireballs at the table.
"
" Marshall: What the hell is wrong with you?
"," Robin: There's alcohol in here.
"
" Barney: You can't turn a ""no"" into a ""yes,"" Ted. Can't be done.
"," Robin: I don't know, Barney. I mean, sometimes persistence pays off. I said ""yes"" eventually.
"
" Barney: No, you didn't. You were like, ""No, we can't, we're friends. It would mess up the dynamic of the group.""
"," Robin: To Ted.
"
" At the Bar
"," Robin: Ted, I hate to say this, but I think it's ""nail the receptionist"" time.
"
" Ted: I know that you are because there's no such thing.
"," Robin: I got it a little bit.

" (cheers)

"
" 1:45, Robin joined Barney, Ted, Marshall and Lily to McClaren's.

"," Robin: They are. Put me know. It's been what?
"
" Barney: Really, as usual.? Think the funniest thing that ever happened.
"," Robin: It's good.
"
" Barney: And twice that.
"," Robin: So a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos?
"
" Marshall: First, nothing is funnier than that. Then it's not such a good story.
"," Robin: Come on, guys. You are four young people active in the most exciting city in the world. And you have nothing to tell me?
"
" Marshall: Get off me!
"," Robin: Wait. It's really funny?
"
" GENERIC
"," Robin: He forgot his pants. It's pretty funny. Less than a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos. I mean, he... he forgot that he was already one? Moron, the monkey.

" Lily: Robin, I will have to borrow the butt of your gun.
"," Robin: I still lost. You come to believe?
"
" Ted: It was great. There was an odd moment near the end.
"," Robin: How to say goodbye in these situations? A kiss on the cheek, too familiar. A handshake, too formal.

"," Robin: The pants.
"
" Lily: Asshole.
"," Robin: What do you mean by linger?
"
" Lily: Ted Horn, critique my painting, anything, that's your business. But I catch you eyeing the mess of my guy and you lingered? You'll be received well.

Now your life is great! Okay, you still live with your ex, which is ridiculous. Laser tag your skills are almost nonexistent. And your wardrobe, it's like, what, you're allergic to fabric quality?Seriously, pull yourself together. What are we talking?
"," Robin: What is the result with the bimbo?
"
" Marshall: Damn! Stop changing the subject. You have gone too far. You are complicit in breaking the heart of this poor guy.And you, you are best placed to know how it feels.

"," Robin: Not me. The key? Discard tips and not looking back. I go to Japan. It took me half an hour.

"," Robin: Well, that's exactly the kind of crap to throw away.
"
" Ted: So you keep a photograph?
"," Robin: It's like love letters, directories or the ashes of people.They take up space. In addition, she will let you not keep half your mess.
"
" Marshall: You're also responsible for damage to Robin when she was your girlfriend.
"," Robin: What damage did I do?
"
" Robin plays hockey in the apartment.

" Marshall: Know that this is quite normal. The major change can be frightening, and fear... it is one of them. So... why not you give me the knife? Give it to me. Go. That way I can unpack too. I will stay with you forever! We had a nice life here.That's why we rejected the package. Because unconsciously, we all know that it would be stupid to leave. It's safe and warm here. There is a downstairs bar, a robot cookie in the kitchen.This is my house and I never leave!

" Marshall: I can not believe my father had read this letter at our wedding.
"," Robin: You can not do that to Lily. Your new apartment a few problems with the floor not right and the sewage treatment plant next door, but you will make a great home. Tell her, Lily.
"
" Lily: This is the black hole where dreams go to die. I move it, either.
"," Robin: Come on.
"
" Lily: Guys, finish unpacking. I will bake cookies to fill R2-plump.
"," Robin: My God, what a band of cowards! Frightened by the slightest change. Terrified by all that is new. Desperate to cling to your comfort zone. I can not go to Japan. What was I thinking? It's so far. I speak the language. I have not even good pictures of you.
"
" Ted: And you should move into the new apartment, and Robin should go to Japan.
"," Robin: Why?
"
" Barney (old): What? Why?

"
" Ted: Oh, man, it's bad enough to have to go through a horrible breakup, but then have that person pop up on your TV? Are you okay?
"," Robin: Well, I'll admit, at first, I felt a little weird. But after the initial shock, I realized something: I've moved on. Finished with that. It was a peaceful moment of closure.

" Ted: That's great. Good for you.
"," Robin: Yeah, thank you.
"
" Lily: Where's the poop, Robin?
"," Robin: Excuse me?
"
" Lily: When I was a kid, I had a dog named Bean. Whenever he made the face that you're making right now, you just knew he pooped somewhere in the house. Where's the poop, Robin?

"," Robin: No!
"
" Ted: Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird. You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees. And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name when he wants to trick us.

"
" Ted: Was that a sincere offer?
"," Robin: First tell me your answer.
"
" Ted: Stay there. Save yourself. We'll spend all day together tomorrow. Okay. Oh, how's Barney feeling?

"
" Lily: Yes. This is our first Thanksgiving. 30 years from now, we're going to look at the photos and say, ""Oh, there's the four people I love most in the world... and Bob.""
"," Robin: I'm sorry,sometimes I forget how seriously you guys take American Thanksgiving. Real thanksgiving happened over a month ago.
"
" Barney: I'm sorry. Did you just say Canadian Thanksgiving was and I'm quoting,""the real Thanksgiving""? What do Canadians even have to celebrate about?
"," Robin: Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find the northwest passage.

"," Robin: I yawned like a million times trying to get him to leave.

" Lily: Yeah, some people just can't take a hint. By the way, I'm really swamped in here.
"," Robin: I kept looking at the clock and sighing... totally clueless.
"
" Lily: Uh-huh. I'm not sure I have time to mash those potatoes, you're standing right next to.
"," Robin: And then Ted does the thing that he always does when there's an awkward silence.
"
" Lily: Yep. masher's right there, next to the pot.
"," Robin: He panics and says the first thing that pops into his head.
"
" [FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: Hey, did you know that the first pies in recorded history came from Ancient Egypt?
"
" Ted: What?! I thought it would break the ice.
"," Robin: I'd already broken the ice with my cool pie fact. then he makes it ten times more awkward.

"
" Ted: Ooh, the oven's pre-heated!
"," Robin: Okay, um... the pecan pie is gonna take the longest. Why don't we put that one in first?
"
" Ted: Pecan pie? Why are we making that?
"," Robin: Um, it's my favorite.
"
" Ted: You're allergic.
"," Robin: I know. I just like smelling it. It's like eating with your nose.

"," Robin: Yeah.
"

"," Robin: Yeah, I-I just thought it might upset you.

"," Robin: I don't know. Is it so ridiculous to think that you might be?
"
" Ted: Yes.
"," Robin: Why?
"
" Lily: No, Ted! What are you doing?
"," Robin: Right?
"
" Ted: The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that we can only talk about the first Thanksgiving,
"," Robin: Come on.
"
" Ted: The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is because I heard noah gave him shotgun in the ark.
"," Robin: Ted...
"
" Ted: The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that I'm just an architect, but he discovered fire. How do you top that?
"," Robin: He's 41! Why are you bashing on him so hard?
"
" Ted: I'm not. I'm just joking around. That's what friends do.
"," Robin: It's mean.
"
" Ted: Well, how come we're all allowed to bust on barney when he dates some skanktron, but when you sleep with the crypt keeper's dad, I'm not allowed to say a word?
"," Robin: First of all, Bob and I are not sleeping together. We're just dating. Secondly, have I said one word about the parade of dubious conquests you've been marching past me the last few months? One of whom got you a butterfly tattoo?
"
" Ted: Hey, that is...
"," Robin: And if you and I are such good friends... why is baking a pie for Bob so weird?
"
" Ted: Yeah, if you and i are such good friends, why couldn't you just tell me that's what we were doing? Okay, maybe we should talk about this later. I-I should get going.
"," Robin: Well, what are we doing? It's Thanksgiving.
"
" Ted: I don't know. I'm sorry. This is stupid.
"," Robin: I'm sorry, too. Of course we're friends. I'm glad we're friends.
"

"
" Lily:...an event Ted is also attending.
"," Robin: kablammo.
"
" Lily: Why are you trying to destroy American Thanksgiving?!
"," Robin: Oh, Lily, it's not as bad as it sounds. Bob and I aren't that serious, and what happened last night with Ted was a fluke.

"," Robin: We need to talk about last night.
"
" Ted: Did you know that some mushrooms are carnivorous? Probably... not?
"," Robin: Ted, can we please just deal with this? Look, I'm not mad. I just think...
"
" Ted: Wait, wait, wait, wait. why would you be mad... you started it?
"," Robin: What?! you're crazy!
"
" Ted: We called a truce, we hugged, and when I tried to pull away, you kept your hand on my neck.
"," Robin: Only because your hand was still around my waist.
"

"
" In Ted's room

"
" Ted: Apparently not.
"," Robin: What does that mean? We're supposed to be friends.
"
" Ted: We aren't friends, are we? Not really. We avoid each other. We smile politely. We're two people who pretend to be friends because it would be inconvenient not to.
"," Robin: Well, maybe we should stop pretending.
"
" Ted: Maybe we should.
"," Robin: So... what do we do now?
"
" Ted: I suppose... we eat dinner. And then that's it.
"," Robin: Okay.
"
" Barney: I thought we were done with that?

" Marshall: So, why did you lie?
"," Robin: Because... It... It... because I like Mitch. Much. There was a... connection specificity. Specificity and feelings.

"," Robin: A what?
"
" Marshall: Classic.
"," Robin: Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?
"
" Ted: It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.
"," Robin: Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.
"
" Ted: He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop.

"
" Ted: It's nothing.
"," Robin: It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.
"
" Lily: Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.

"
" Ted: Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.

"
" Ted: You know about this?
"," Robin: Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?

"
" Marshall: With the nearby Canada, Minnesota, we like to make jokes on your back and they are often on the same theme.
"," Robin: As fear of the dark?
"
" Marshall: Yes. For example, everyone, how many Canadians does it take to change a lightbulb? ""What? No, the bulb is dead? I'm afraid! ""
"," Robin: This is stupid. Why do you think Canadians are afraid of the dark?
"
" Marshall: Where do prejudices? A stereotype appears, and suddenly, it spreads like fire. Asians misbehave, the Scots are stingy, the Brazilians are too many stamps. I doubt it works.You can not hang out with people who belittle your beloved country. I take you back.
"," Robin: No, wait. I have something to say. Everyone. Let me tell you something about Canadians.

"
" Marshall:... who was the scorer who missed the penalty?
"," Robin: Rashad Tarkenton.
"
" Man 1: Goodbye.
"," Robin: You know what? I'm glad you know it because I am proud to be Canadian. It was not a good NFL team or Prince, but we invented Trivial Pursuit. Anything, the Earth! In addition, in Canada, you can go to a strip club full of alcohol and order. And yeah. Moosejaw in the Bay of Fundy, you can whistle your pint of Pilsner while watching a minor girl to get naked. Jealous? In Canada, people do not care where you come from, as you are whisked away nice and possibly a cigarette, or when a donut. I am proud to come from the ""Great White North""... and I want to be right now. And was not afraid of the dark. Finally, we do not really like, but like everyone else.
"
" Marshall: Sorry about what happened inside. I was stupid. I should say anything.
"," Robin: I'm sorry. That was your cue. I should not have my own.But every year during the holidays, I am homesick. And so far, every year, I had a reason to stay: a boyfriend, a job or something. But... This year, for the first time, I have nothing.
"
" Marshall: But if.
"," Robin: What?
"
" Marshall: We love you all. If you ever leave again in Canada, we jump on a plane, you are pursuing, and after that Barney has dragged some of the club with which you have spoken, we will bring you here where you are supposed to be. This is not New York without Robin Scherbatsky.
"," Robin: Thank you.
"
" Marshall: Yeah.
"," Robin: I miss sometimes. I wish I could close my eyes and find myself one hour in Canada.
"
" Marshall takes Robin to another bar.
"," Robin: How did you find this place?
"
" Marshall: Just like home, eh?
"," Robin: There's only one way to know.
"
" Man: Sorry. I had not seen. Are you okay?
"," Robin: It's OK.
"
" Man: OK, I apologize. Take a donut, it's a gift.
"," Robin: thank you.
"
" Marshall: OK. You come home in him, he apologized and you file a donut free?
"," Robin: It's like home.

" Ted: What is she doing for money through all this?
"," Robin: Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.
"
" Ted: Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?
"," Robin: No.
"
" Lily: Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.
"," Robin: I'm sorry.
"
" Ted: Robin, nothing to add?
"," Robin: No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.
"
" Lily: Thank you.
"," Robin: Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.
"
" Barney: And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.
"," Robin: A what?
"
" Marshall: Classic.
"," Robin: Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?
"
" Ted: It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.
"," Robin: Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.
"
" Ted: He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop.
"," Robin: Did you show lily your design?
"
" Ted: It's nothing.
"," Robin: It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.
"
" Lily: Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.
"," Robin: Hey, guys. What's going on?
"
" Ted: Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.
"," Robin: Why? Was he being mean?
"
" Ted: You know about this?
"," Robin: Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?
"
" Lily: Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.
"," Robin: I gave them to you for your birthday.
"
" MacLaren's.

" Lily: I know. Say what you want about him, but Barney is better blonde.
"," Robin: True. The blonde does not go to any guy.
"
" Marshall: I love you buddy, but it is impossible that the blond you go well.
"," Robin: It would not look good.
"
" Don: So that's why Monty and I have vowed never to take drugs.Because the drug is bad. Not true, Monty?
"," Robin: Of course... the chemical stuff, yes. But, what grows in nature, they can try, like, a couple of times.
"
" Don: We do not try to Shadow Zone, Monty.
"," Robin: I think that we should not lie to kids, Moo-Moo!
"
" Don: So... what do you mean?
"," Robin: I've tried drugs.
"
" (Don kisses Robin.)
"," Robin: What was that for?
"
" Don: Before you, I had given up everything. Relationships, my career, my pants. You have given me want to try again. I love you for that.

"
" Ted: Helen, dryer stops!
"," Robin: Is Chicago.
"
" (Back to the hair salon...)
"," Robin: Why it happens now? While all was well with Don. This is the never ending battle of my life: career vs. love.
"
" Ted: ""Endless Battle""? Your career has crashed love for years.It's like the Globetrotters vs. the Generals. Crochet career in half, the love is greenhorns who deserve it the Italian league.
"," Robin: I'm lost. What do I do?
"
" Ted: You really need to talk to Don.
"," Robin: I'm too upset to talk with him. I have to avoid the time I decide what I want.
"
" Ted: It sounds logical. Sorry to not be able to help you more than that. In truth, I can not be objective about the fact you're gone.
"," Robin: You did a manicure?
"
" Ted: First, I get lots of compliments. Then tell her.
"," Robin: It gets no compliments.
"
" Ted: The other thing.
"," Robin: It may be that I moved to Chicago next week.
"
" Ted: Friends, I'm doing well. Robin has something important to say.
"," Robin: It failed him.
"
" Ted: The other thing.
"," Robin: He had a manicure.
"
" Ted: The other thing.
"," Robin: I had a job offer in Chicago.
"
" Barney: That's why we're all here. For Robin to deter...
"," Robin: Actually, I already made my decision. Friends, I must accept.
"
" (Robin joins them.)
"," Robin: So I was on the phone with Chicago.
"

"
" Don: You'll never believe it. I was offered the position of presenter WNKW in Chicago.
"," Robin: You said what?
"
" Don: Wait. Trying to understand.
"," Robin: I'm going.
"
" Don: Wait. Put yourself in my place. You can imagine what it is to be offered a dream job?
"," Robin: I can. Good luck in Chicago, Don.
"
" (Robin arrives in tears at Ted's apartment.)
"," Robin: Say yes to that.
"
" Ted: Yes.
"," Robin: I can re-move? (Ted takes her in his arms. They sit on the couch) Is I'm the biggest idiot in the world?
"
" Ted: Think of all of us, five years ago, when we met you.Marshall and Lily were friends as little. Today they are married and think about the children. And Barney? He would never get involved with anyone. And last year, he fell in love. And me? I was chasing a girl, convinced she was right. Today it is one of my best friends. And you? 5 years ago, you would never put love before your career, but now you did it.
"," Robin: Seems like I become more and more stupid.
"
" Ted: Just more courageous. We all looked for the 5 lookalikes.But eventually, over time, we all become our own doubles.These completely different people who look exactly like us. The ""Robin, there was 5 years""? This girl was pretty cool. Robin lookalike? She's great. (They are close) We drank a lot.
"," Robin: I do not care.
"
" Lily: Is not it?
"," Robin: It looks like Barney.
"
" Lily: For me it would be Hugh Jackman.
"," Robin: You know, the celebrities, they like really weird s*x stuff. Believe me.
"
" Barney: How do you know that?
"," Robin: It's embarrassing, but I... I came home one evening with a celebrity.
"
" Lily: My God! Seriously?
"," Robin: He wanted to do weird things with me, so I left. That's it.End of story.
"
" Barney: But before you poursuives, I'm flattered, but technically I'm not a celebrity. Also, one last time, the mask, it was a joke.
"," Robin: Not you, Barney.
"
" Marshall: Now you've spun him hiccups.
"," Robin: I'll tell you anything specific. But all I will say is that he is Canadian, but you know it. And he brought home by offering to show me a single collection.
"
" Marshall: What do you mean ""collection""?
"," Robin: As you collect stamps or coins. But I say nothing.
"
" Barney: Tell us at least the weird thing he wanted to do.
"," Robin: I know not what you call it, but we have a name for it in Canada. Listen, I've already said too much.
"
" Lily: So the mystery celebrity who collects something mysterious asked you to do a mystery Canadian s*x act.
"," Robin: Yes.
"
" Lily: Tell us.
"," Robin: I'll tell you. But only if you correctly guess the three parties.
"
" Marshall: It is simply impossible.
"," Robin: Right.
"
" Lily: What is a Zamboni with 2 hands?

"," Robin: No, it's the collection. Harvey trays. These orange trays they give you when you eat at Harvey. Restaurants? Will you take a trip on the Trans-Canada Highway, you have a hollow between Milverton and Wawa, where you stop eating, eh? At Harvey. More than 12,000 customers!
"
" Lily: So fame was...
"," Robin: The Frozen Snowshoe. Oh, my God! You know Racket jelly? This is the most famous pro wrestler of Canada. I met him after his victory over Rick ""The Daredevil"" at the Rogers Memorial Arena in Kamloops in 2002. A classic.
"
" Lily: So you say you Racket Jelly invited him home to show you trays of Harvey, and you've asked him to do an Old King Clancy?

"," Robin: Yes, the guide.

"
" Ted: Hello? Hello, PJ. Where are you? You're never late.You're mounted on the Empire State Building? Listen to the old lady. She knows stories. Take your time. (Hangs up) Wait.""Ted Mosby House."" The call comes from within! (He opens the bedroom door and discovered Robin in bed with PJ) This is not the Empire State Building. You can not sleep with my assistant. I try to work here, me. How did that happen?
"," Robin: At noon, when you go to any walk of reflection, that leaves us time to spend together.

" He left the apartment, leaving Robin with PJ.
"," Robin: Tell me, PJ, I have a question for you architecture.Ted's ass what taste?
"
" PJ: No idea, but probably the taste of engineering.
"," Robin: It's locked?
"
" PJ: Visitors must register for the key.
"," Robin: Listen, PJ. And I want you to think seriously before answering. You tell me I can not go to the bathroom with me?
"
" PJ: I tell you that you must ask permission to use the toilet in my premises.
"," Robin: Why does it excite me?
"
" Ted: There's billions of guys on Earth. Why do you sleep with him?

"," Robin: Sorry?
"
" Ted: There is a history of architecture on a famous architect who designed the library. She was perfect. But every year, sinking a few inches into the ground. Obviously, the building was condemned. He forgot to take into account the weight of books. This box... it's just me. If I ever thought not to books?
"," Robin: No one goes to the library, so you do not care of this type. And you must pick up the phone and call customers.

"
" Ted: Are you kidding? At 30, I had to have an insolent success, being married to the perfect woman, maybe a kid on the way. Instead, I'm just a guy sitting in his apartment, which is a competition look with his phone. And who loses.

"," Robin: Ted, you've nabbed seven peanuts in a row. Impressive but not enough to be published.
"
" Ted: seven in a row. But I speak not of it. I talk about my selection for the construction of a scale model of the Empire State Building for the greater recovery of the New York skyline in the world.
"," Robin: That's the thing with which you played the other day?
"
" Ted: How long are you here?
"," Robin: Ten seconds.
"
" Lily: I do not think there's a gun to my Marshmallow. Now, I tremble. I think I will not sleep all night.
"," Robin: Oh, sweetie. I have a trick to help you sleep. (She pulls out his gun) Glue this under your pillow. You'll sleep like a f*cking baby.

"," Robin: It's going to hurt someone. There is the... security.

"," Robin: So, where did they find?
"
" Lily: I think naked in a tree, throwing his feces.
"," Robin: I've seen. That's why I take the taxi.
"
" Ted: They tracked!
"," Robin: What's happening?
"
" Marshall: Do not shoot. There was no banana!
"," Robin: Come on, Barney. I know that Marshall has not been mugged by a monkey.
"
" Ted: What? Him in your program? And my model?
"," Robin: No one wants to see a guy who comes to play with dolls.
"
" Robin interview a man with dolls.
"," Robin: So, your dolls are favorites of Rhinebeck prices next month.
"
" Ted: And you invited back for a second interview.
"," Robin: Because the FBI wanted to be occupied while they searched his home. Come on, Marshall. I need history. It has everything. Crime, monkeys, no stupid model of the Empire State Building, which takes me all my living room and smelly glue everywhere. Go. Do this for me... As a friend?
"
" Marshall: Really? Cool.
"," Robin: Who knows someone who has been mugged by a monkey?
"
" Marshall: Nobody except the good people of Thailand, China, Costa Rica and many other countries where the crime committed by the monkeys is a common nuisance.
"," Robin: The best is that it is possible that the story goes on national TV. Guys, this story of the monkey attacker can make me famous.
"
" Ted (2030): Late the next night, we went on board the issue of Robin.
"," Robin: Do not be nervous. We will sit down... It's that thing, whore?
"
" Ted: I know. Looks like something covered by a sheet. If you want to discover, you will have to do a story on it.
"," Robin: It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid.
"
" Marshall: The monkey is there.
"," Robin: Surprise. We thought it would help to bring you to confront your abuser.
"
" Ted (2030): And then the interview began.
"," Robin: In your own words, describe what happened.
"
" Marshall: Well... I'd love to tell you what happened, Robin. But... I really want to know what's under that sheet.
"," Robin: We talk about that. We speak your aggression.
"
" Marshall: People are attacked every day in New York, Robin, do we often see what's under that sheet? You can shoot it?
"," Robin: We come back.
"
" Mike: It's good.
"," Robin: What are you doing?
"
" Marshall: What are you talking, baby? Of course I do.
"," Robin: Great, tell it to America. Five minutes.
"
" Lily: Tell us just what happened.
"," Robin: Yes, tell us the truth.
"
" Ted (2030): And that was it. We never knew what really happened to the portfolio of Marshall. But we know that. Aunt Lily has never had a weapon, Robin's credibility remained intact, and Bobo and Milly lived together at the Central Park Zoo.
"," Robin: sh1t. Okay, put a microphone.
"
" Marshall: I can't believe Barney is talking to his dad right now.
"," Robin: Yeah, what do you say after three decades of not seeing each other?
"
" Ted: Okay, now I feel bad about making fun of him for the tool thing. My dad was the one who taught me all that stuff.
"," Robin: Well, to be fair, everyone has some glaring gap in knowledge, something really obvious you somehow never learned.
"
" Ted: Okay, but a screwdriver? Come on, I don't have any gaps that fundamental.
"," Robin: Really? I seem to recall...
"
" Ted: Okay, I learned that word by reading it. That's how I've always pronounced it.
"," Robin: Ted, that wasn't easy. It took a lot of ""ch-aracter"" to admit that.
"
" Ted: Okay, Scherbatsky. You want to tussle? I'll tussle.
"," Robin: You want to tussle? Let's tussle.
"
" Ted: Marine biologist.
"," Robin: Please, no.
"
" Scott: So this really sucks, but I'm going to be in the North Pole for the next three months.
"," Robin: Seriously? The North Pole? Okay, pal, if you want to break up with me, just tell it to me straight. Don't pretend you're going someplace we all know doesn't exist.
"
" Scott: Um, I'm going to be studying the mating habits of...
"," Robin: Of who? Santa's elves? Rudolph? You know what? I'm going on a trip, too, Scott. It, uh, starts in Narnia. It works its way up to Candyland, and then, hey, congratulate me, because I'm the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Expelliarmus!

" Scott: Robin, the North Pole is a real place. You know that, right?

"," Robin:  Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day.
"
" Barney: In my experience, the way this normally goes is, we lie here for a while, make a little awkward chitchat.
"," Robin: Check.
"
" Barney: Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery, rocket test flight I've got to be at, slip out of the apartment and never call you again.
"," Robin: And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, ""who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?""

"
" Ted: OK, first of all, that is interesting. Second, we have to tell him.
"," Robin: No, we don't. He's just starting to get better. Going out with Barney. How do you think he'll feel when he hears Lily's moved on?
"

" Ted: Five American bucks.
"," Robin: Dammit! OK, so how do we get the truth out of her?
"
" Ted: Interesting. Wow Lily, you, uh, seem to be having a pretty strong reaction to losing this apartment. I wonder is it because it reminds you of something you lost because you couldn't commit?
"," Robin: No, Lily you're crying over the crown moulding and the real hardwood floor. There's no deeper meaning, right Lily? Just quit crying and tell him.

""Feelin' fine and gettin' some 'jine. You may have noticed the giant plate of hot wings in front of me. I know how much you love hot wings. Too bad someone bribed the kitchen to take them off the menu tonight. So, if you want some, you're going to have to come back to GNB. But hurry, this offer will be gone lickety-split. (Barney licks his hot wings peace by peace then throws them down) Do evil laugh."" Oh, um... (makes a poor impression of Barney's laugh) So, what are you turds up to?

" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: Um... thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story.

"
" Marshall: He has a lot of keys.
"," Robin: Okay, Ted, can you just please think about this before you...
"
" Ted: There's nothing to think about. I-I can't lose Zoey. That's the only thing that matters to me right now.
"," Robin: Okay, Ted... you know I love Zoey. But, look, sometimes... I go play chess in the park. And the key to chess... Okay, I play online. But the key to chess... Okay, it's Angry Birds! But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario.
"
" [ROBIN'S FIRST SCENARIO]

" Ted: Yes
"," Robin: And you're happy for, like, a second, until you realize the building you helped save has just become a monument to everything this woman made you give up, and you resent her for it, so much so, in fact, that you dump her.
"
" Ted: You said there was a third scenario.
"," Robin: Right.
"
" [ROBIN'S THIRD SCENARIO]
"," Robin: The chairman asks you...

"
" [END OF ROBIN'S THIRD SCENARIO]
"," Robin: That one's less likely. What I'm saying... what I hate saying... is this. You and Zoey are gonna break up. But you can still save your career and Barney's.
"
" Lily: I mean, yes, this is a huge, divisive issue for them. Which means no matter what happens, there's gonna be a lot of resentment. Probably lasting for years... infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship. So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this.
"," Robin: Thank you.
"
" Ted: This is a nightmare. I can't believe she kept that tape. The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow, and based on today...
"," Robin: They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place.

"
" Marshall: It's just something Lily read in ""Psychology."" It's good, she read in ""Cosmo"". Okay, I read in ""Cosmo"". Well, it was in ""Cosmo Girl"". Drive, OK?
"," Robin: Why make a fuss a little ritual is abandoned.
"
" Marshall: It's more than that, OK? This is our little rituals. You know what we did when I got home?

"," Robin: How dare you?
"
" End flashback
"," Robin: All of these little rituals, nice, cute... This is stupid. Say what we ate? They look like kids playing in the dinette.
"
" Marshall: Maybe you think it's stupid because you've never had a relationship that lasts long enough for that.

"," Robin: Nothing to be done. I will not sit here and insult me.We're not going to the airport. We go. (The snowplow passes and buried under the snow) It's been what?
"
" Marshall: Robin, I'm sorry. You're not a robot. If you are, you are a very advanced model, and the human race has no chance. You did not choose to show your love through rituals tacky, and that's good. But maybe we did that because we have always done and we know no other way. What I know is that if there sitting alone at the airport, I have to go get her.These are the rules.

"," Robin: She's gone!
"

"
" Lily: Seriously, Ted is fine? I mean, I know that the weekend was hard, but hey... it's weird radio silence.
"," Robin: I know. His mother called such five times to ask where he was.
"
" Barney: Sorry Robin. They are all out of pretzels. And I know how you're emotional. (He gives her a stack of paper towels) Shh. Leave it alone.
"," Robin: Okay! Okay, I... I cried during the song Clint.
"
" Lily: Ted, where were you?
"," Robin: Is that okay?
"
" Ted: So, I thought this piece would be the desktop. You see, a place just for dad. I mean, kids can come if they read a book, but no toy. This is not about to hold my love. It is rather a question of drawing a boundary.
"," Robin: Whoa.
"
" Lily: Ted, you can not go on like this where you will make your life. It does not work like that.
"," Robin: Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done.

"," Robin: Wow, Barney. You've been crying about this guy or what?
"
" 10 minutes earlier...
"," Robin: Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?
"
" Barney: Of course.
"," Robin: I made a mistake in letting you go, right? Your pen1s is huge.
"
" The man was taken on a stretcher.
"," Robin: Hey, good, good news is that the inspector has killed some cockroaches at the time of impact.

"," Robin: Oh! I can't decide. It could be any one of them.
"
" Barney: No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is.
"," Robin: Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up.
"
" Barney: That's not a bad idea.
"," Robin: I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on.

"," Robin:...she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation.

"," Robin: Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger.
"
" Barney: Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?
"," Robin: Get your hand off my thigh, Barney.
"
" Barney: It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin.
"," Robin: You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?
"
" Barney: Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?
"," Robin: No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom.

"," Robin: Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other.

"
" Ted: Hey, Marshall.
"," Robin: Hey.
"
" Barney: How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful.
"," Robin: To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have.
"
" Ted's father: Hello.
"," Robin: Hello.
"
" Ted's father: A real looker.
"," Robin: That's funny, I didn't even ""look"" in the mirror today. That's not anything, is it? So, I made a reservation at San Marino tonight for 8:00.

"," Robin: How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.
"
" In the kitchen.
"," Robin: What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass.

"
" Ted's mother: Not now.
"," Robin: Okay, if you don't, I will.
"
" Ted: One last thing about my mom. She grills every single one of my girlfriends about when we're gonna get married and have kids.
"," Robin: But this is the first time she's meeting me.
"
" Ted: Doesn't matter. And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin Stacy: six kids in five years. The woman's basically a ride at a water park.
"," Robin: But I don't want to get married and have kids. What am I supposed to say?
"
" Ted: You know what? You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions. You shouldn't have to apologize for them.

" Ted's mother (to Robin): So, dear...
"," Robin: Oh, boy.
"
" Ted's mother: Tell us what it's like being a journalist.

"," Robin: Oh. Uh, I thought you, um... It's great.
"
" Ted: You lucked out with my mom last night, huh? What a relief, right?
"," Robin: Oh, absolutely. Whew, what a relief it is to know I'm the one girlfriend your mom doesn't want you to have kids with.
"
" Ted: Hooray?
"," Robin: I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl would pop out attractive children? 'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry, that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman.
"
" Ted's mother: Oh, no, thank you. Isn't she sweet?
"," Robin: Well, if she's so sweet, maybe she should have Ted's babies.
"
" Ted's mother: Excuse me?
"," Robin: Nothing. (She leaves the table to go to the bathroom, the door is locked, she knocks.)
"
" Ted's mother: Robin, dear, did I say something to upset you?
"," Robin: Why don't you want me to have your grandkids?
"
" Ted's mother: Do you want to have my grandkids?
"," Robin: No! I mean, I don't know. I just... I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids. And you should. I'm a genetic gold mine. No family history of diabetes or heart disease. Everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight. I had one schizophrenic uncle but even he had perfect vision. Which was unfortunate for the people around the bell tower he was in, but still he was a very fine man, and...
"
" Ted's mother: Robin, it's not that I don't want grandkids. It's just I don't think anyone should make the mistake of getting married too young.
"," Robin: Why do you say that? I mean, you got married pretty young. That wasn't a mistake. Was it?
"
" Ted: I'm gonna kill him.
"," Robin: I don't care how unpleasant it is, you have to talk to him.
"
" Ted's mother: Not now.
"," Robin: Okay, if you don't, I will.
"
" Ted: Serious talk? Mom, what...? He was kissing another woman. Don't you care?
"," Robin: Mrs. Mosby?
"
" Ted's father: Sorry.
"," Robin: Wow.
"
" Ted: I know.
"," Robin: They love me!
"
" Okay.
"," Robin: Okay, we're back live in 30 seconds.
"
" Barney: I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues.
"," Robin: Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.
"
" Barney:Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted.
"," Robin: Aw, man! Why?
"
" Ted: Uh, hi again. Ted. Oh, and, Jerry, you remember my girlfriend.
"," Robin: Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.
"
" Ted: Not Okay. That place is lame.

"
" Barney: Guys, focus.
"," Robin: Oh, I like Focus. Let's go there.
"
" Ted: Where?
"," Robin: Not Where. Focus.
"
" Marshall: So Closed is open.
"," Robin: No, Closed is closed.
"
" Jerry: I don't know. Third base! Right?
"," Robin: Ew, Third Base is all frat guys.
"
" Ted: Not Okay. Okay is lame.
"," Robin: Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar.
"
" Jerry: I might be allergic to this stamp.
"," Robin: Oh, my God, my secret crush is here.
"
" Lily: Mila Kunis?!
"," Robin: No, my secret crush. We met a few years ago.
"
" Man: Hi. I could use a woman's opinion. Is this working for me?
"," Robin: Uh... no. (laughs) The only good thing about how ugly that shirt is, is that it distracts from how terribly it fits you.
"
" Man: I was trying on the pants.
"," Robin: Oh. (Laughs)
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: I had to leave before we could finish talking, so that was it. You know, ever since then, I've always... Oh, my God, he's coming over here. Oh. Hello.
"
" Man: Hi. A few years ago at a department store... did you embarrass the hell out of me?
"," Robin: Oh, I'm sorry, you must have me confused with the shirt you were wearing that day.
"
" Man: Right. Um... it was really nice to see you again.
"," Robin: Mm-hmm. You, too.
"
" Barney: Can you believe it? This is awesome!
"," Robin: Barney, how is that awesome?
"
" (Barney and Jerry leave)
"," Robin: Okay, Jerry's gone; Let's break up.
"
" Ted: Okay. ""I would have stolen you a whole orchestra."" There. What's the rush?
"," Robin: Well, that guy who came over here who thinks we're dating, I kind of have a crush on him. Can you help me clear it up?
"
" Ted: Really? That guy? He was, like, a four.
"," Robin: A four? God, you are, like, the worst judge of guys ever. Okay, if he is a four, what are you?
"
" Ted: Hey! I'm not perfect; I'm an eight... and a half.
"," Robin: You're a doofus and a half.
"
" Ted: Fine. Let's go talk to him. Where'd you meet this booger-eater anyway?
"," Robin: At a close-out sale at Dawes.
"
" Ted: Hey, Robin.
"," Robin: Oh, Ted. Oh, no.
"
" Ted: Let me guess. Someone wants to knock... boots. Boots. (imitating gunshots)
"," Robin: Just take off your damn shirt. Okay.
"
" Ted: All right.
"," Robin: All right. Whoa, stop.
"
" Ted: What?
"," Robin: Stop. Perfect.
"
" Ted: But I... I can't see, and you can't see me.
"," Robin: Yeah. Yeah, just like that.
"
" Ted: You were picturing your crush!
"," Robin: Well, somebody had to.
"
" Ted: Okay, okay, answer me this. Are you absolutely sure it had nothing whatsoever... to do with the boots?
"," Robin: Yes.
"
" Woman: Congratulations!
"," Robin: Oh, hey! Thank you so much. We're super excited. We're thinking June. (laughs) Yeah, okay. Okay, jerk, do you remember how you ended up buying those red cowboy boots?
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: So get off the field at the Superdome, because you ain't no saint.
"
" Marshall: Hello.
"," Robin: I, uh... Oh.
"
" Lily: Aw, sorry that secret crush didn't work out for you.
"," Robin: Oh, it's okay. I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
"
" Lily: Why are you smiling?
"," Robin: I don't know. Good night.
"
" Ted and Robin are et the bar.
"," Robin: How about Mimi's?
"
" Ted: Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's.
"," Robin: Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go.
"
" Ted: Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's. You love that place, remember what a great time we had the last time we were there?
"," Robin: We did?
"
" Ted: Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining. It was so romantic? How can you not remember this?
"," Robin: Because it wasn't me.
"
" Ted: Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on. Remember when we went to see it? We sat in the back row.
"," Robin: I've never seen Van Helsing.
"
" Ted:  That's right. I saw it with my sister.
"," Robin: My boss just got back from Maui. He said it was really romantic.
"
" Ted: Oh, it's so romantic.
"," Robin: When were you in Maui?
"
" Ted: I... went... with my sister.
"," Robin: With my sister. Why do you always say that? Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people. It's silly to try to act like we didn't.
"
" Ted: You're right. We should just be honest.
"," Robin: Totally.
"
" Ted: See that girl over there? Three years ago, I totally made out with her.
"," Robin: I don't want to hear that.
"
" Ted: What? You said...
"," Robin: God, that is so insensitive.
"
" Ted: Remember honesty...?
"," Robin: You're a jerk!
"
" Flashback. Ted and Robin are on the couch.
"," Robin: Mm, we should get down to the bar.
"
" Flashback.
"," Robin: Damn, my face is so dry. Is there any moisturizer around here?
"
" Lily: No! Seriously, stop!
"," Robin: So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist... face lotion...
"
" Flashback.
"," Robin: Wow, this is great stuff. Now I know the secret to your great complexion.
"
" Ted: What are you talking about? It's yours.
"," Robin: No, it's not.
"
" Flashback.
"," Robin: Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?
"
" Ted: Um, my sister's.
"," Robin: So, in other words, some girl you went out with.
"
" Ted: Um... I love you.
"," Robin: Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?
"
" Flashback.
"," Robin: Why is that still in your apartment?
"
" Ted: I don't know. I just never threw it out.
"," Robin: Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl?
"
" Ted: Yeah. I'm madly in love with her, and the only way I can deal with it is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion.
"," Robin: Not three dollars! Try 14.
"
" Ted: Why is this such a big deal?
"," Robin: Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer!
"
" Ted: Whoa, she wasn't a whore.
"," Robin: Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town. It sounds like a whore to me. What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around?
"
" Ted: Nothing. That's it. Well, except for the phone booth. And the lamp by the desk... and the...
"," Robin: No. No! No! Oh, Ted!
"
" Lily: Ah, the age-old question: after you break up with someone, what do you do with the stuff?
"," Robin: Question? Ain't no question, girl. Obviously, he's got to get rid of it.
"
" Ted: Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it.
"," Robin: So we agreed that we would let you guys decide.
"
" Marshall: Nice, right?
"," Robin: I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old
"
" Marshall: Creamsicle and turkey gravy, not at the same time.
"," Robin: Well, that's adorable, but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see.
"
" Ted: Really? You can't look at a pillow without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow!
"," Robin: Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross.
"
" Ted: You're creepy and gross.
"," Robin: Your mom's creepy and gross.
"
" Barney: Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.
"," Robin: Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?
"
" Ted, Robin and Barney arrive in the room where Lily's going to play.
"," Robin: Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?
"
" Barney: I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.
"," Robin: Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.
"
" Ted: Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer.
"," Robin: And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, ""Now we are really cookin'!""
"
" Robin and Ted arrive at Ted's apartment.
"," Robin: Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play?
"
" Ted: I know. He can be really insensitive.
"," Robin: It was pretty bad, though.
"
" Ted: Oh, my God, it was so bad.
"," Robin: Oh, my God, you've been robbed!
"
" Ted: Nope.
"," Robin: All that stuff was from old girlfriends? Don't you buy anything for yourself?
"
" Ted: You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff. But seeing how happy it makes you - totally worth it.
"," Robin: Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have s*x with you when I'm really tired.
"
" Ted: Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Well, sit. Sit, yeah. So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?
"," Robin: Nope. Well, except for my dogs.
"
" Ted: So I had to get rid of everything from my past relationships because you don't keep things from your past relationships except, uh, where are your five dogs from? Oh, that's right: your past relationships.
"," Robin: What's your point, Ted?
"
" Ted: Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment, and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends?
"," Robin: What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends?
"
" Ted: I do now.
"," Robin: That's ridiculous.
"
" Ted: You said everything.
"," Robin: But not living things.
"
" Ted: Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away.
"," Robin: Things with a heartbeat can stay.
"
" Ted: Enjoying this?
"," Robin: Pickles, go get your ball. Go get your ball.
"
" Ted: Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you to make me get rid of all my stuff.
"," Robin: Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs?
"
" Ted: Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs.
"," Robin: Um, no.
"
" Barney: Even I wouldn't do that.
"," Robin: Yes!
"
" Robin and Ted are in Robin's apartment.
"," Robin: I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from.
"
" Ted: I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them. That was ridiculous.
"," Robin: So we're-we're okay?
"
" Lily: Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh?
"," Robin: Yeah, he really is. It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs. Might be time to send them to the farm.
"
" Lily: You're gonna kill your dogs?!
"," Robin: No! No, no, no, there really is a farm. My aunt has a farm upstate.
"
" Lily: Oh, thank God. Aw, you know, if I were five dogs, I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn.
"," Robin: Yeah. I could visit them on weekends. My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty.
"
" Lily: Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs.
"," Robin: ""They""? What do you mean by ""they""?
"
" Ted is about te enter in his apartment.
"," Robin: Hey.
"
" Ted: Where've you been? I called you earlier.
"," Robin: I gave my dogs away to my aunt.
"
" Ted: You what?
"," Robin: Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but... I think it's for the best.
"
" Ted: Wow. Oh, man.
"," Robin: Can we go inside?
"
" Ted: Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar.
"," Robin: Why? What's going on inside?
"
" Ted: Um, the floors are gone.
"," Robin: What?
"
" Ted: I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!
"," Robin: You said you threw all that stuff away!
"
" Ted (voix off): Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had. It was one of those fights that last for hours and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about. We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window. Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy. But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me, but somehow we got to here.
"," Robin: We're really doing this?
"
" Me?
"," Robin: And the Captain wasn't glaring at you.
"
" Snorkeling.
"," Robin: Then, after I saved you from destroying
"
" Hello, sailor.
"," Robin: No!
"
" Lily: Surprise.
"," Robin: We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here.
"
" Lily: Oh, it goes back and forth. It's sort of a tranny car.
"," Robin: How long have you had her... slash him?
"
" Marshall: My brothers handed it down to me when I was 16.
"," Robin: Oh, how nice of them.
"
" Ted: Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco.
"," Robin: What's the 100K fiasco?
"
" Ted: Well, it's a pretty old car.
"," Robin: Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life, but it's really mostly machine at this point.
"
" Marshall: Hitchhiking Waldo. (a guy is sitting between Barney and Marshall in the car)The homeless guy who broke in through the window and threw up all over the backseat.
"," Robin: Lily, don't. Be strong. Do not go all ""prisoner's dilemma"" on me.
"
" Flashback. In Ted's apartment...
"," Robin: An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long.
"
" Lily: I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule.
"," Robin: But Thai food, Lily. Pad Yum Mao. Tom Kai Gah. Thai See Ran.
"
" Lily: Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious. Okay. Here's what we'll do. We'll drive over, pick it up, have them double-bag it, very carefully drive it back here with the windows open, and he'll never know. (Lily slows down the car and knock down the food). Wow, these brakes are really sensitive. Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me! This and the difference between ""affect"" and ""effect"" are the only two things he's really serious about.
"," Robin: Lily, it's gonna be fine.
"
" Lily: No, it's not. Marshall's gonna freak. Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do? Oh, God, oh...!
"," Robin: Shut up! Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking. Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage. Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts-- the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up. Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai. You mentioned cigars.
"
" Lily: There's two in the glove compartment, but he's been saving them.
"," Robin: Hand me those chopsticks. Hey, how about some tunes? Oh, great song.
"
" Lily: These cigars aren't helping at all.
"," Robin: Yeah. This was a terrible idea.
"
" Marshall: Why did you break two of them?
"," Robin: It looked like fun when she did it. So I wanted to try.
"
" Barney: Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here.
"," Robin: Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?
"
" End of flaxhback.
"," Robin: Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car.
"
" Marshall: It is on. It is on! Like the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.
"," Robin: What?
"
" Ted: Wow! You guys are getting married in two months.
"," Robin: How are you going to get everything done?
"
" Ted: Was it...?
"," Robin: It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.
"
" Ted from 2030: And so, Aunt Lily had the plan to crash the prom.
"," Robin: I'll go with you.
"
" Lily: Really?
"," Robin: Yeah. I never got to go to my prom. We always had field hockey nationals in the spring.
"
" Barney: Lesbian.
"," Robin: The cough is supposed to cover the ""lesbian.""
"
" Ted: Hey, why don't we all go?
"," Robin: I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in. We don't want to mess things up for Lily.
"
" Lily: Well, we have to get in. I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday, 'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have...
"," Robin: Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay? Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it.
"
" In the bedroom
"," Robin: I never thought this would be a bad thing, but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.
"
" Lily: I didn't know I still had this.
"," Robin: What?
"
" Barney: Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing.
"," Robin: No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore...
"
" Barney: Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?
"," Robin: No. I've never been to prom before, okay?
"
" Lily: Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids.
"," Robin: Is this gonna work?
"
" Barney: It's cool. Time to activate plan B. Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow? Scherbotsky?
"," Robin: Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?
"
" Boy: We don't have that kind of money.
"," Robin: For free.
"
" Boy: Oh, hell yeah!
"," Robin: Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily.
"
" Boy: Sure. I knew it would happen. This is the dream.
"," Robin: Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?
"
" Boy #1: Hey, uh, you ladies want something to take the edge off?
"," Robin: Yeah, what the hell? It's prom. That tastes like cough syrup.
"
" Boy #1: Yeah, we couldn't get any alcohol. Um, our fake IDs say we're only 20. We didn't realize it till after we bought them.
"," Robin: Nerds who aren't good at math? Life's going to be rough, boys.
"
" Boy #1: So, you buzzing, baby?
"," Robin: My phlegm feels looser.
"
" Marshall: Okay, Ted. (His phone starts rigging) Hello.
"," Robin: Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music for ""Good Feeling"" and bring it out here, like, now.
"
" Ted: Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame! I don't even want to go anyway.
"," Robin: Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us.
"
" Ted: What'd she say? What'd she say?
"," Robin: He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me. I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive. Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's, it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes.
"
" At the prom
"," Robin: All right, sheet music's on the way. Are you okay?
"
" Lily: What?
"," Robin: Well, we did promise them one dance.
"
" Boy #1: So, uh, what's the deal here? Am I getting lucky tonight?
"," Robin: Oh, Sean, look, um, you're a nice guy, but I just don't... No, you're not getting lucky tonight.
"
" Lily: I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior.
"," Robin: I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me. I'm going to ask you something and, um, maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever. But, um, are you having second thoughts?
"
" Lily: I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to. The travel, the bohemian art life, my big lesbian experience. I didn't do any of it.
"," Robin: Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world. I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined?
"
" Lily: Yeah.
"," Robin: And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint. And as far as your lesbian experience... Happy?
"
" Lily: Yeah. So field hockey, huh?
"," Robin: Shut up.
"
" Ted: So how was your first prom?
"," Robin: You tell me. I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me, there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl.
"
" Ted: So, basically, it was a prom.
"," Robin: Okay, I've missed you. Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way, not even in an I-forgive-you way. Just in a I've-missed-you way.
"
" Narrator: When Robin strolled into the bar and said.
"," Robin: Say you're my bitch.
"
" Ted: I'm your bitch. Why this time?
"," Robin: Because tonight, I am getting us all into ""Okay"".
"
" Barney: No... a friend of mine named, shut up.
"," Robin: Yeah, well the owner goes to my gym. It turns out that he is a fan of my reporting for Metro News One. So now, I'm on the list for tonight.
"
" Ted: Nice going, Scherbatsky. You're becoming a long and difficult-to-spell household name.
"," Robin: He's even getting me into the VIP room.
"
" Barney: Yeah, he just wants to show you his own VIP if you know what I mean...
"," Robin: Okay, what does ""VIP"" stand for in your universe?
"
" Barney:... I know that the ""P"" is pen1s.
"," Robin: Alright, so you guys are in. Should I invite Marshall and Lily?
"
" Ted: So, no. Lily and Marshall will not be doing this.
"," Robin: Got it. Anyway, Ted, part two of my story: my friend Kelly's going to be there.
"
" Ted: Kelly, who supposedly I'm gonna love?
"," Robin: Oh, you are gonna love Kelly. She's fun, she's smart, she lives in the moment.
"
" Barney: Translation, she's ugly, she's ugly, she ugs in the ugly.
"," Robin: Oh, and she's totally hot.
"
" Barney: So, do you have any other hot single fr...
"," Robin: No, Kelly works with the news breakers...
"
" Barney: Question is: do these strategies ever not work for me? Either way the answer's ""about half the time"".
"," Robin: (Shows up) My bitches! Check this out. (To Doorman) They're with me. (Doorman allows them in)
"
" Ted: This place seems great. Is Kelly here?
"," Robin: Yeah, she's around somewhere. Let's go find her, I'll introduce you guys. Then I should probably dock into the VIP room, so stupid and arbitrary isn't it, who get's to be in VIP and who doesn't?
"
" Ted: Can we come?
"," Robin: It's... not that arbitrary...
"
" Barney: (Subtitle) Okay, it's a little loud.
"," Robin: (Subtitle) There's Kelly. (Leads them through the crowd)
"
" [Okay Club - Robin/Ted/Kelly/Barney]
"," Robin: (To VIP room doorman. Subtitle) Robin Scherbastky? (Door man shakes head) Robin Scherbatsky! (Doorman refuses. Robin walks away)
"
" Marshall: Hey, Robin.
"," Robin: Hey!
"
" Marshall: Why aren't you inside?
"," Robin: I'm calling the owner, there's a guy in there who won't let me in to the stupid VIP room. What are you doing here?
"
" Marshall: Oh, I had this move. So I came here to bust it. Can you get me in? (Motions to doorman that he's with her)
"," Robin: Great, voicemail.
"
" Marshall: Thanks, I'll see ya.
"," Robin: Bye.
"
" Phil: Holy Crap. We just saw Brian Affleck! (High-five)
"," Robin: (On Phone) And it's not that I care so much about getting into the VIP room, I have been in tons of VIP rooms, not exactly a VIP room virgin. (You see doormen changing shifts) Seriously, call me back. (Turns around to doorman #2) Oh, um... I was just in there. Robin Scherbatsky, I'm on the list.
"
" Doorman#2: Name's already crossed off, sorry.
"," Robin: But, I'm Robin Scherbatsky. I'm a reporter for channel one.
"
" Lily: Hey.
"," Robin: Hey.
"
" Lily: Marshall just ditched out on our own party. Can you get me in there? I kind of need to kill him.
"," Robin: Actually, I can't even get myself in. I was such a dork. I get recognized one time and I start thinking I'm Julia Roberts. No VIP. I'm not even an IP. I'm just a lonely little P sitting out here in the gutter.
"
" Lily: He just left, in the middle of our own party, you don't do that. Unless, of course, you're chasing after someone who's already done it, and then I think it's okay.
"," Robin: Well, I hate to take his side... but come one a wine tasting? What's the big plan for next Saturday, scrabble night?
"
" Lily: Don't check your email.
"," Robin: Why are you becoming this person? I heard that in college you flashed a campus tour group on a dare.
"
" Lily: Once on a dare. The other times were just for fun. I'm not in college anymore. I'd love to go back and be that person again, but you can't move backwards you can only go forward.
"," Robin: Um, pause... you can go wherever you want. I guess the question is where do you want to go?
"
" Lily: I want to go into this club and find my fiancé.
"," Robin: Well that you can't do. (Silence)
"
" Barney: Ted, the only reason to wait a month for s*x is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.
"," Robin: Good news: I don't have to cover the cat show tomorrow night. Who's up for hanging out?
"
" Lily: No, no, we can't, it's our nine-year anniversary.
"," Robin: Wow, nine years? Your relationship's a fourth grader. Congrats.
"
" Marshall: It's one of New York Magazine's ""Top five romantic getaways on a budget."" Who says sexual can't be sensible?
"," Robin: Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me.
"
" Barney: Really?
"," Robin: Actually, I was talking to my martini.
"
" Barney: Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say ""wow.""
"," Robin: Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident.
"
" Barney: It's one of the many risks of the blind approach. It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot. But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.
"," Robin: Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?
"
" Barney: You can't just... Wow!
"," Robin: Hey? What's taking so long? I have to go.
"
" Barney: Not so fast, Scherbotsky. I like the way you think. That mirror thing. Simple. Elegant. Okay, limited-time offer: I need a ""bro"" for my bro-ings on about town. How would you like to be said bro?
"," Robin: Well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped. She really needs some support... or a stranger's tongue down her throat. That seems healthy. All right. Guess I'm in.
"
" Barney: You suited up!
"," Robin: Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right.
"
" Barney: Emilio? The woman will have...
"," Robin: I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks.
"
" Barney: Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. ""The Torpedo."" Or, as the rollers call it, ""Piramide.""
"," Robin: My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention.
"
" Barney: Father issues. Hot.
"," Robin: I know... I was this close to being a huge slut.
"
" Barney: Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl.
"," Robin: Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have s*x to get pregnant.
"
" In a bar
"," Robin: So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?
"
" Barney: Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still...
"," Robin: What?
"
" At Laser-Tag
"," Robin: Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!
"
" Barney: Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months.
"," Robin: Oh, I believe it... this is awesome!
"
" Barney: Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you?
"," Robin: Thank me later. Let's keep moving. These little bastards are everywhere.
"
" At Laser-Tag
"," Robin: Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it.
"
" Barney: No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does.
"," Robin: But I...
"
" Barney: Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky.
"," Robin: See you on the other side.
"
" Barney: Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?
"," Robin: Yeah.
"
" The Bar
"," Robin: Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game.
"
" Barney: Neither have I. Of course I cheat.
"," Robin: Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L.
"
" Barney: Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.
"," Robin: Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox.
"
" Barney: Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt.
"," Robin: That's a woman.
"
" Barney: Oh, my mistake. Or is it?
"," Robin: Let's just focus on your target.
"
" Barney: Right.
"," Robin: Yeah, I got this one. Oh, my God. I love your jeans.
"
" Woman: Okay. Is this a lesbian bar? Because that girl with the blue shirt just...
"," Robin: Oh, no. I am all about the dudes. Although pickings are pretty slim tonight. Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get.
"
" Woman: Really? 'Cause he's totally vibing me right now. Must be the jeans.
"," Robin: Well, jeans will only get you so far. I'm going home with him.
"
" Barney: Hey.
"," Robin: Hey.
"
" Barney: Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.
"," Robin: What happened?
"
" Barney: Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release.
"," Robin: But why?
"
" Barney: Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores.
"," Robin: Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship?
"
" Barney: Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake.
"," Robin: Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys.
"
" Barney: Hard-core? That's the only way I play. (Barney strips down)
"," Robin: I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing?
"
" Barney: I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me?
"," Robin: No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends.
"
" Barney: Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night.
"," Robin: What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.
"
" Barney: You invited me up to your apartment to ""play Battleship."" Is that not an internationally recognized term for s*x?
"," Robin: No.
"
" At Robin's
"," Robin: Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second...
"
" Barney: But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well.
"," Robin: Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted?
"
" Barney: Totally gave us his blessing.
"," Robin: Really?
"
" Barney: Really.
"," Robin: So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?
"
" Barney: Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh...
"," Robin: What?
"
" Barney: You like Ted.
"," Robin: I didn't say I liked Ted.
"
" Barney: You like Ted. Wow. This is huge.
"," Robin: Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for...
"
" Barney: Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?
"," Robin: You're not gonna tell him, are you?
"
" Barney: No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro.
"," Robin: A-7.
"
" Barney: Miss.
"," Robin: Of course.
"
" Marshall: Or see your new poster rap.
"," Robin: Post rap? On which it would work?
"
" Lily: You got a mini pig?
"," Robin: You can see the mini pig?
"
" Ted: Someone does not want to lose his Dark Brown.
"," Robin: She gave you her hook.
"
" Barney: Yes, completely.
"," Robin: It gives you false hope, but it does not engage with you, but it keeps you in the corner, just in case, like... an old canned chili in the pantry.
"
" Marshall: Amen, sister.
"," Robin: Do you feel pretty good. It is gone. It was on both sides. I was hooked and crocheter. It's good guys. I was shameless, but I did not have money problems.
"
" End flashback
"," Robin: ""Right now"" is the catch phrase of choice.
"
" Ted: Friends, good news. Tiffany broke up with her boyfriend. So I'm not the hook.
"," Robin: You're always on the hook.
"
" End flashback
"," Robin: And let me guess: it's not gone further than that.
"
" Ted: I've never done that.
"," Robin: Are you kidding? And this daughter of the university library? Henrietta?
"
" Ted: Henrietta and I are just friends.
"," Robin: It is too much to your hook.
"
" End flashback
"," Robin: You like to have Henrietta close for the same reason that Tiffany likes to have you close, it flatters the ego.
"
" Ted: You amaze me that such an expert is to keep people on your hook. And this poor cameraman your job?
"," Robin: Mike and I are just friends.
"
" Robin sits on the couch, eating a chocolate cake and a massage the feet.

"
" Ted: That's not why it's good.
"," Robin: And Henrietta, in any way, are not losing time with you, huh?
"
" Barney: Yesterday I was with this girl so sexy that pharma should call a doctor if you have no erection for more than 4h. I have no reason people?
"," Robin: There is no one. Just the girl with whom you came out recently.
"
" Barney: It's over.
"," Robin: What?
"
" Barney: The girls of pharma are more than gunnery. This is the end of an era.
"," Robin: You're a little dramatic.
"
" End flashback
"," Robin: What did you do?
"
" Ted: It was violent.
"," Robin: Sorry, big guy. Honesty is hard, but ultimately it is the softer alternative. (Mike enters with the laundry basket) I must tell you something. You've finished the laundry fragile?
"
" Mike: Another tour.
"," Robin: It can wait.
"
" Ted and Robin are at the bar when Barney comes.
"," Robin: How are you?
"
" Barney: I've realized that their reign had to stop to give way to a sexy new profession. It may be... communications officer in an intergalactic spaceship to a distant solar system that we can imagine. Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits.
"," Robin: Why change your mind?
"
" Marsall: Hey, get this. You know my friend Max from law school? He's at Gregor's Steakhouse downtown, and Woody Allen is sitting two tables over. He wants us to come check it out.
"," Robin: I don't know, it could be cool. I've never seen Woody Allen.
"
" Marsall: What?! Robin, how can you be a New Yorker and never have seen Woody Allen?
"," Robin: I have seen plenty of other famous people. Last week I saw... Maury Povich.
"
" Marsall: Maury Povich is everywhere. I'm sorry, Robin, but you're not a real New Yorker until you've seen Woody Allen.
"," Robin: I am, too, a real New Yorker.
"
" Ted: That's adorable. You're from Canada.
"," Robin: I have been here for almost six years. It's not like I just got off a boat.

" Marshall: No, you're not a real New Yorker until you've killed a cockroach with your bare hands.
"," Robin: Those rules are all stupid, okay? I've never done any of those things.
"
" Barney: Why would I do that? I'll see him at poker on Tuesday.

" Barney: What, you really had something to talk about?
"," Robin: Yes. Look, I've spent the last,six years in this city, focusing on my career, all for nothing. Some lady almost got me killed. Maury Povich stole my cab. I swear, this city is starting to reject me like a bad organ transplant. You know, everyone keeps saying that I'm not a real New Yorker. Well, maybe I should just stop trying.

" Kevin: What?
"," Robin: No.
"
" Kevin: But it's, uh, time for Sports.
"," Robin: No, it's not. It's time for Weather.
"
" Kevin: We, we just did Weather.
"," Robin: Well, weather's pretty fickle, it may have changed. What's it doing out there, Lou?
"
" Kevin: Okay, now it's time for Sports.
"," Robin: No! Let's go to Traffic Todd in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper.
"
" Man: And we're clear.
"," Robin: I'm sorry.
"
" Woman: Um, Robin, is it just me, or were you doing something different there?
"," Robin: I haven't watched the game yet. I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl. I mean, change the teleprompter. No team names, nothing specific.
"
" Woman: That is crazy. I can't do that.
"," Robin: My friend Mark passed away this week.
"
" Man: Back in five... four... three...
"," Robin: It's just so hard.
"
" At Robin's work.
"," Robin: And after the Super Bowl, the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up, sending the mayor of the winning team's city 15 pounds of a delicacy his of her city is famous for. Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor.

" Robin's finishing the news.
"," Robin: And let's end the day on a happy note. There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo. Trish Sanchez has the story.
"
" Trish Sanchez: ...the zoo decided to name the baby panda after Super Bowl champions...
"," Robin: No...!
"
" Ted: Awesome. Just in time for kick-off. None of you guys found out the score, right?
"," Robin: Mission accomplished.

"," Robin: I almost got fired today.
"
" Marshall: Hi!
"," Robin: Hi!
"
" Lily: How did it go with Dale?
"," Robin: You know, sometimes, the guy with thick glasses and a t-shirt of the Smurfs, it's just a cliche. And sometimes it is a moron with a squint and a platonic relationship with Gargamel.
"
" Barney: That brings us to the second night. You see the bomb that pampers its Black Russian (Vodka and coffee liqueur)? She left to exchange it with a White American. Enter me five! You know... If you're not careful, you'll lose me.
"," Robin: Guys, when Dale called for a second hot date, what do I tell her?
"
" Marshall: How do you know he'll call?
"," Robin: How cute, Marshall. But I think mom knows when she was a hit. I mean, he could not help but look at me.
"
" Ted: Have you finished?
"," Robin: You asked him if she had reached the right exit?
"

"," Robin: Yeah, Ted, we know tons of people who call Jen.
"
" Ted: Jen Coulin.
"," Robin: Oh, you're there. The dreaded call from Dale. Oh, that's my mother. She has big health problems. But why does he not call?
"
" Lily: Wait a second. Want it called?
"," Robin: No! Shut up! You have not a kind of toothbrush to share or something like that?
"
" Ted: No, there was a toothbrush in the bathroom, and it was mine.
"," Robin: Wait. Are you saying that for 8 years, you have shared a toothbrush every 3?
"

"," Robin: Why do you...
"
" Marshall: Oh, my God, you've really pushed to the limit.

"," Robin: It's only been five days, he will call!
"
" Marshall: What do you care? You said it was a big con.
"," Robin: Tell Dale not like that, ok? It is twice as good as you never will!

"," Robin: What? Why? Because the guy with the weird cut went back?
"
" Marshall: I was there. Damn, this guy could play.
"," Robin: I'm still not.
"
" Lily: Ok, let me do it the Canadian So how do you react if one of those guys with skates and sticks came back here?
"," Robin: Lily, if one of the Vancouver Canucks came here, I fall on my ass so that there would be a hole halfway to China in the soil.
"
" Ted: It's the same thing for the Yankees.
"," Robin: Oh, Barney's done.
"
" Ted: Yeah, I got my first drop.
"," Robin: I met my soul mate, and he never called back. Well, not yet. He will. He will.
"
" Barney: You share a toothbrush?
"," Robin: Well, they and Ted.
"
" Ted: Wait a minute. When we went out together, you borrow the toothbrush all the time.
"," Robin: Oh, sh1t.

"
" Ted: Uh, I have perhaps not been clear is the... Robin Ball Architects.This event is a very hip.
"," Robin: Ok, name one celebrity who will be there.
"
" Ted: Lenny Kravitz.
"," Robin: Lenny Kravitz will be there?
"
" Ted: Yes. He is there every year. And it's a rock star.
"," Robin: You know, Ted, in hindsight, it is too early to choose between these two girls. Takes a friend. Like, I dunno, maybe a friend who has a poster of Lenny Kravitz on his wall, and may or may not have dated this post and transported from his high school...
"
" Robin leaves his room in evening dress.
"," Robin: Oh, that? It's nothing. It cost me three months' rent, and uh, I have never worn because I bought it for a big party to which you would have asked what did not happen. But, you know what? Do not feel guilty.
"
" Ted: What big event?
"," Robin: This thing with your uncle.
"
" Ted: His funeral? It fell into the water, he emerged miraculously from his coma.
"," Robin: And I forgive you. Now I can have my place and meet Lenny Kravitz?

"
" Ted: Right there. Leonard Kravitz, world-renowned architect. This guy is a star. He will make his famous reading of 90 minutes on the beams.
"," Robin: Well, great. I'll go find one myself and hang myself.

"," Robin: Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up.
"
" The whole gang's at the bar.
"," Robin: Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking.
"
" Ted: Why would you say that?
"," Robin: Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that.
"
" Ted: Tony.
"," Robin: Angela.
"
" Barney: Mona.
"," Robin: Mona?
"
" Barney: Watch it more closely. Rock your world.
"," Robin: So, what are you gonna do?
"
" Ted: Knock yourself out.
"," Robin: Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing. Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?
"
" Flasback Robin's work.
"," Robin: Vicki, um... I'm so sorry about this, but there's been some budget cuts and, um, we have to let you go. I mean, after tonight. I still need my makeup for the broadcast. So... (Robin on TV wearing a lot of make-up.): Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims.
"
" Ted: No.
"," Robin: What is that?
"
" Barney: I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time.
"," Robin: Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it.
"
" Barney: Oh, come on, Robin.
"," Robin: No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun.
"
" In Ted's apartment.
"," Robin: So, you didn't fire him?
"
" Marshall: Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture.
"," Robin: And, uh... I... got you a rose.
"
" Barney: Hey, guys. Guess what I got. A new dart.
"," Robin: Oh, wow, a new dart.
"
" Ted: Hey, that new dart is great.
"," Robin: I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney.
"
" Ted:  Nude art.
"," Robin:  Nude art.
"
" Marshall: This painting is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
"," Robin: Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost?
"
" Ted: One of my worst fears has come true-- I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked. Well, I gotta go. Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office.
"," Robin: Oh, I'll go out with you. Bye, guys.
"
" Robin and Ted are at the apartment. Mr Druthers is on the couch.
"," Robin: So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him.
"
" Lily: What's going on? There are queuing outside the McLaren's.
"," Robin: Why it's almost that guys?
"
" Lily: Look at all these guys. The sidewalk will feel the pee now.
"," Robin: We'd better find a new bar.
"
" Barney: What... are you crazy? It's a sexy barmaid. Do you know how long I've waited for me... My friends, I slept with many women in my glory days. Lawyers, professors, poets, doctors, professional riders, and animators... A butcher, a baker, a candle maker. Yes, we got to the part where it rhymes. A teacher, a restorative, an observer... A puppeteer, a croupier, a housewife, it is also a job, guys. A circuit court judge...
"," Robin: Abbreviates!
"
" Barney: I never, never slept with a barmaid sexy, until tonight.
"," Robin: It's not so sexy.
"
" Ted: Would you jealous of the attention? Imagined would be the sexiest girl in the bar?
"," Robin: No. Shut up!
"
" Lily: A new super sexy barmaid.
"," Robin: You see? Marshall does not think she's sexy.
"
" Lily: Now that you have been looking more closely, admit it: the bartender is the sexiest of the Bar.
"," Robin: The second sexiest.
"
" Barney: It's easy. I just have to stop wearing costumes.
"," Robin: Is that all? Come on, you're always in costume.
"
" Barney: True... But for these two... And, for that... Finally, for her... I'll stop wearing, wait...
"," Robin: We know you're gonna say ""costumes"".
"
" Ted joined Robin, Lily and Marshall sitting at their usual table.
"," Robin: So, your date with Cindy?
"
" Ted: She exaggerates, there, right?
"," Robin: Well, Ted, she's right.
"
" Barney: We have the remains cremated. Its buttons have saved a sick jacket of the Upper East Side.
"," Robin: Finally, you can abandon the quest for so-called sexy barmaid.
"
" Marshall: I'm just, like, me, my friend, against it, its old.
"," Robin: You two, the fact that it is not real sexy! She is sexy thanks to circumstances! Look.
"
" Carl: What are you doing?
"," Robin: What?
"
" Carl: You do not have the right to be there.
"," Robin: Carl, listening. No. I do not want to leave. Mercy, mercy, do not force me to leave.
"
" Carl: You have to go. You have to go.
"," Robin: I was someone there, behind! Everybody loved me.
"
" Barney: Costumes!
"," Robin: What would you choose: a million girls and one three parts?
"
" Marshall: No. It's called manners, jerk. Now, what's-what's going on in New York? Give me something.
"," Robin: There is one thing that's been going on. Uh, it's about Ted... and Zoey.
"
" Ted's appartment
"," Robin: I thought the oven was Celsius.
"
" Marshall: Robin, I just want you to know, it's either this story you're telling me or another game of Clue against myself, so make it good.
"," Robin: Oh, it's good. You see, after that night, none of us heard from Zoey for a while.
"
" [FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: Finally, Ted called her up.
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: She is a lovely person... warm, intelligent, just kind of gullible. It's like, every word out of her mouth makes you want to be like, ""Oh, honey.""
"
" Marshall: Oh, honey.
"," Robin: I know. You just want to wrap her up in a blanket and give her a cup of tea. She's, like, this little lost lamb who needs to be protected from the wolves. Speaking of whom...
"
" Barney: Oh, honey.
"," Robin: So the night went on, and eventually everyone went home, except for Ted and Honey.
"
" Barney: Why do they call 'em coasters?
"," Robin: And Barney.
"
" Ted's appartment
"," Robin: Good for you. Ted Mosby does not take advantage of poor, helpless honeys.
"
" Ted: Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.
"," Robin: Hmm?
"
" Ted: Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.
"," Robin: Hmm?
"
" Marshall: Ted's in love with Zoey? But, but she's married. That boy needs an intervention.
"," Robin: Funny you should say that.
"
" Lily: Finally.
"," Robin: Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair.
"
" Ted: This is love. And this was my grandmother's watch. Anyway, now I have only one course of action in front of me: I have to end my friendship with Zoey.
"," Robin: Isn't that a little harsh?
"
" Lily: Harsh? Robin, a single guy and a married woman cannot be friends if one's in love with the other.
"," Robin: Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now, too. It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her. She'll always be around.
"
" Ted: Then what am I supposed to do?
"," Robin: Okay, just shut it down. Okay, just ignore your feelings. If-If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self. Look, I like Zoey. Without her, my dinner party wouldn't have been such a success. So those feelings of yours... shut 'em down.
"
" Marshall: Oh, um, that's my other line. It's not a number I recognize.
"," Robin: So don't answer it.
"
" Marshall: Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking... Listen, Robin. I know. I apologize for my wife. She never should have...
"," Robin: Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her.
"
" Marshall: Me? You dragged me into this?!
"," Robin: You just went through a tragedy. It's not like she's gonna call you up and...
"
" Marshall: Oh, God, that's my other line. Oh, God, it's a 917 number, and I don't recognize it! I think it's Zoey!
"," Robin: Just don't answer it.
"
" Marshall: I can't not answer. It's impolite.
"," Robin: Marshall, you can beat this.
"
" Marshall: I can't turn my back on politeness.
"," Robin: You don't have to answer. You can just let it ring.
"
" Marshall: Good manners are what separate us from those ""elbows on the table"" Wisconsinites.
"," Robin: You can do this. I believe in you. Don't do it, Marshall!
"
" Ted: You are wrong. The ladies dig the professor look.
"," Robin: You know, there is something to that. I remember thinking my tenth grade math teacher was very sexy. I wonder if Harold's still in jail. What? Tax evasion. Among other things.
"
" Lily: So guys, Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place for a little couples' night.
"," Robin: Uh, sure. Why not?
"
" Lily: Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place for a little couples' night.
"," Robin: Um, sure, why not?
"
" Ted: Hey, how was the big couples' night with Marshall and Lily?
"," Robin: Brutal.
"
" Barney: It was like we were on a date with a sad, chubby girl our mom made us call.
"," Robin: And they were so nervous, that they weren't even making sense half of the time.
"
" Ted: Let me guess: Did Marshall get, like, super intense about the cheese?
"," Robin: Yeah, how'd you know?
"
" Barney: Um, we-we-we didn't realize there was gonna be dinner. We sucked down a couple tacos outside the subway.
"," Robin: P.S., not sitting great.
"
" Ted: Come on, they just got excited. They've been looking for couple best friends forever. Plus, I'm sure they weren't that bad.
"," Robin: Show him.
"
" Marshall: Oh.
"," Robin: Yeah, tough luck, every Saturday night I've ever had, 'cause this one just blew you out of the water.
"
" Barney: Let's do it again, soon.
"," Robin: Yeah, we'll call you.
"
" Ted: They're your friends! Why would you just blatantly lie to them like that?
"," Robin: Well, that's what you say at the end of a crappy date.
"
" Ted: Right?
"," Robin: Who was that?
"
" Barney: (he laughs) You're the sexless innkeeper.
"," Robin: Oh, my god! You're right! He's totally the sexless innkeeper!
"
" Barney: I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you.
"," Robin: Which is funny, because usually it's the innkeeper who offers turndown service. Oh!
"
" Lily: Hey, guys. Good news. First of all, you can ignore all the e-mails and texts we've sent you.
"," Robin: We have. Go on.
"
" Lily: Because we went ahead and booked that couples' weekend for all of us inVermont!
"," Robin: Wait, you guys were serious about that?
"
" Lily: What's going on?
"," Robin: Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys.
"
" Marshall: Let's go.
"," Robin: No...Lily...
"
" Ted: Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger.
"," Robin: You're right.
"
" Ted: Thank you.
"," Robin: All that sexlessness has made you wise.
"
" Lily opens the door.
"," Robin: Hey. We wanted to say we're sorry.
"
" Lily: Um, listen, now's not a good time. We'll call you.
"," Robin: Wait. We just want...
"
" Marshall: Yeah, sorry.
"," Robin: Oh, it's just... We haven't seen you guys all week.
"
" Barney: Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out.
"," Robin: Yeah.
"
" Lily: Anyhoo, we can't stay long. We're just gonna grab a quick beer and then take these kooks for a boat ride around the city.
"," Robin: Wow, it sounds like this is getting pretty serious.
"
" They both join their friends, letting Robin and Barney alone.
"," Robin: Pfft, who needs 'em?
"
" They enter in a restaurant.
"," Robin: Hi. Two for dinner.
"
" Barney: Hey, why don't we call that weird couple down the hall from you? You know, with the ferrets? Maybe they want to come over and play taboo.
"," Robin: After midnight? No way. We can't tabooty-call them, it's pathetic.
"
" Marshall and Lily join them.
"," Robin: For charades.
"
" Lily: How do we know you two won't hurt us again?
"," Robin: You don't.
"
" Robin appears from her room.
"," Robin: Barney, you ready for brunch with Lily and Marshall?
"
" Victoria: Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted. It's our two monthiversary, so we're going out to dinner.
"," Robin: Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask.
"
" Lily: Robin!
"," Robin: Oh, come on. We bust on each other. We're just at that place in our strong friendship.
"
" Victoria: Really? Oh.
"," Robin: Get off me. Oh, see? I did it again.
"
" Victoria: Yeah. Huh. I should take this. Hello.
"," Robin: Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster?
"
" Lily: Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them?
"," Robin: The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.
"
" Lily: Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.
"," Robin: I saw a couple up front that were nice.
"
" Victoria: At least we get free champagne!
"," Robin: And cake.
"
" Victoria: Mm-hmm.
"," Robin: Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?
"
" Victoria: I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One. That's pretty hard to walk away from.
"," Robin: Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months.
"
" Victoria: But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted. He's amazing. He's the best guy I know.
"," Robin: Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.
"
" Victoria: I really don't...
"," Robin: s*x. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This b*st*rd's kicked.
"
" Victoria: Just horrible.
"," Robin: It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses.
"
" Victoria: Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.
"," Robin: A cat person. Why am I not surprised?
"
" Victoria: I did hear barking in the background. Maybe he was in a pet store. Does he want us to get a cat together?
"," Robin: Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.
"
" Victoria: That is low. Do you really think that's what he's doing?
"," Robin: Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany.
"
" Lily: Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.
"," Robin: Ugly, ugly, ugly.
"
" Lily: Are you okay?
"," Robin: I'm fine.
"
" Lily: Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.
"," Robin: I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship.
"
" Victoria: Oh, look how happy she is. You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women who would never let any guy mess with my career. And now I'm actually thinking about it. I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something.
"," Robin: I know what you mean.
"
" Victoria: See, that's what I'm afraid of.
"," Robin: Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.
"
" Victoria: Robin... I think that you are the coolest. I'm so glad that we're friends.
"," Robin: Oh, no way... you're the coolest.
"
" Victoria: No, you are.
"," Robin: Okay, I am.
"
" Lily: Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.
"," Robin: Wow, you look incredible.
"
" Lily: Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?
"," Robin: Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.
"
" Lily: Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married. (She sits on the cake, without noticing it) Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?
"," Robin: Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake.
"
" Victoria: But, you know what? It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry.
"," Robin: Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.
"
" The Bar
"," Robin: Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune.
"
" Lily: No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.
"," Robin: Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.
"
" Go.
"," Robin: Hey, guys, for the last time, this place is enormous--
"
" Oh.
"," Robin: Oh, yeah.

" IN. ROBIN'S APARTMENT
"," Robin: He's cheating on me.
"
" Lily: What?!
"," Robin: Why else would he buy me flowers? He's gettin' some on the side.
"
" Lily: Oh, come on, Robin. Barney's not the type of guy who would... Go on.
"," Robin: Plus, he keeps saying he's working late. But when I call his office, they say he left hours ago.
"
" Lily: Well, that doesn't prove anything.
"," Robin: Yes. Proof. Go word. I'm glad you brought that up. Barney's briefcase. He forgot it here this morning. (taking Barney's briefcase).
"
" Lily: And what do you plan on doing with it?
"," Robin: We, we-- you and I-- are going to open it up and look for evidence. Ted probably has a sledgehammer around here somewhere.
"
" Marshall: Hey, I've been down in the basement storage area going through all the stuff that Lily and I left behind when we moved out. I'm Robin. We should've cleared it out for you much sooner.
"," Robin: There's a basement storage area?
"
" Lily: Oh, that's great, honey.
"," Robin: What the hell is that?
"
" Marshall: Until we found out that Lily was allergic to barrel resin
"," Robin: (slowly) Barrel resin?
"
" Lily: Just go with it.
"," Robin: So you need a hand throwing it out?
"
" Marshall: No, I'm not... I'm not just going to throw her out, okay? Mabel's like family.
"," Robin: So, um, what are you gonna do with Mabel?
"
" Marshall: I want to give her away, um, to a lucky new owner. Do you know anyone?
"," Robin: Yeah, hmm, let me think. Do I know any rodeo clowns? Oh, that's weird, I do. But even Lenny wouldn't go near that mess.
"
" Marshall: This is so exciting. Right now there's some out there who has no idea that tonight they're going home with just... just the best barrel.
"," Robin: Well, let's just hope they're not allergic to barrel sin like Lily here.
"
" Lily: Now, can we please get out of here?
"," Robin: Yeah. I'll grab my coat.
"
" Robin hits the briefcase with a big hammer.
"," Robin: Oops.
"
" Lily: A college notebook?!
"," Robin: Oh, my God, he's cheating on me with some college girl. I knew there was a skank but I thought she'd at least be dumb.(reading the notebook) ""Birthday: July 23.Favorite hockey team: the Vancouver Canucks. Age: 29, but tells people that she's 26."" Oh, my God,these are notes about me. Or some 29-year-old version of me.
"
" Lily: What do you know about this,Marshall?
"," Robin: Why would Barney have a notebook full of information about me?
"
" IN. ROBIN'S APARTMENT

"
" IN. ROBIN'S APARTMENT
"," Robin: ""Defusing the bomb""? What does that even mean?
"
" Lily: (reading) ""Three Topics To Distract Robin From Being Mad At You.""
"," Robin: ""Distract"" me? Oh, that is so condescending. These guys are really starting to piss me off!
"
" IN. ROBIN'S APARTMENT
"," Robin: What?! That's not distracting. That's just talking about the story of a scrappy little underdog team that prevailed despite very shaky goal ending and, frankly, the declining skills of Trevor Linden.
"
" IN. ROBIN'S APARTMENT
"," Robin: You have to clean your gun. My uncle had a filthy old shotgun, blew both his thumbs off trying to shoot a beaver. You want to distract someone, make them watch my uncle try to eat corn on the cob.
"
" IN. ROBIN'S APARTMENT
"," Robin: Did you know that before intercourse, the male and female emperor penguins bow to each other? Mr. Penguin (bowing). Mrs. Penguin (boxing). Oh, God, silly penguins, acting all fancy. ( she laugs) What were we talking about?
"
" Marshall: Well, he doesn't know that, baby! God!
"," Robin: Ted's only teaching Barney horrible things about me.
"
" Lily: I think 's nice that Ted knows you that well.
"," Robin: Ah, well, too bad it's next to a page entitled...
"
" IN ROBIN'S APARTMENT
"," Robin: (closing the book) Okay, can I just say that my deepest need in life not to have my father to say, ""I am proud of you, eh?""
"
" Marshall: So why are you crying now?
"," Robin: I'm not crying.
"
" Lily: (hugging her) Oh, sweetie. Can I get you some butterscotch?
"," Robin: Oh, stop it.
"
" She sighs. And look again in the book.
"," Robin: Wait a second. It says here that the class meets at 6:15 on Tuesday.
"
" Lily: So?
"," Robin: That's right now.
"
" Robin, Lily and Marshall come into the class.
"," Robin: Yeah, I have one.
"
" Barney: I got this. So, emperor penguins-- crazy, huh?
"," Robin: What the hell do you two think you're doing?
"

"," Robin: Dude, it's a barrel!
"
" Ted: Aw! You're giving Mabel away?
"," Robin: I have so many questions. Why would you do this? What were you thinking? Who the hell is that guy? (showing a guy in the classroom).
"
" Ted: Oh, that's Shin-Ya. He's sort of been auditing the class.
"," Robin: ""Auditing""?
"
" Barney: On the bright side, he came in handy standing in for you during the role-playing exercises.
"," Robin: Wait. You did role-playing exercises where I was played by Shin-Ya?
"
" Shin-Ya: (speaking Chinese) They made me wear a wig, It was very demeaning.
"," Robin: You know, I can't believe you, Ted. You actually think you're some kind of an expert on me?

"," Robin: You know, half the stuff in this notebook is patently wrong.
