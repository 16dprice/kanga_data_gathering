," Robin: ""Robin Scherbatsky's Surprising Erogenous Zones""? Let me clear something up for you, Jeffery.
"
," Robin:  (embarassed) Oh. Yeah...
"
," Robin: Oh, uh, no. Um, the right one's ticklish, I guess. But the left one, yeah, I'm glad you're back there. Because that is just some sweet, sweet lovin'.
"
," Robin: We had just started dating. I was being nice.
"
," Robin: (to Steven) And you. You know, I got it into my head this week that you were cheating on me. I even broke open your briefcase to look for evidence.
"
," Robin: You know, in a way, I was right. You cheated. You can't get some crib sheet on dating me. That's not how it works. If we didn't figure out how to be with each other in a real, honest way, I don't see the point of even trying.
"
," Robin: What do you want?
"
," Robin: I guess I'm impressed by how much you remembered.
"
," Robin: Well, since you know me pretty well... am I fooling myself with this whole Miriam thing?
"
," Robin: You're an idiot.
"
," Robin: You know...
"
," Robin: That notebook, um, does contain a lot of personal info, and I think it has my home address.
"
," Robin: Thanks for lending me these boots. Where did you get them from?
"
," Robin: Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've begun a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave.
"
," Robin: That is so fascinating. So what happened?
"
," Robin: Wow, gosh, separating conjoined twins. That must be the most amazing feeling.
"
," Robin: That is so funny. You are so funny.
"
," Robin: Bring me a razor.
"
," Robin: They've been surgically removed by Dr. Awesome.
"
," Robin: Holly, please, he's really cute and I really like him. And he's got a British accent.
"
," Robin: Felecia, I have pounded three cappuccinos waiting for you. Pretty soon I won't have to shave, the hair is going to vibrate off my legs.
"
," Robin: Juanita, he can't see my legs like this. I look like a Turkish lesbian
"
," Robin: There is a pharmacy across the street. Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?
"
," Robin: Where's the shaving cream?
"
," Robin: Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream?
"
," Robin: Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude?
"
," Robin: Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies room. I've got TB...tiny bladder. I'll meet you out front?
"
," Robin: You've gotta be kidding me.
"
," Robin: Excuse me.
"
," Robin: I'm here, I'm fine, my head is bleeding. Going down again.
"
," Robin: Maybe.
"
," Robin: ""This long-distance thing sucks, huh? And I really need to talk to you tonight.""
"
," Robin: She's not going to break up with you, Jose.
"
," Robin: Do you want to come over?
"
," Robin: Hi, Connor, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over?
"
," Robin: Sit. Good boys. Okay, remember, stay out of the liquor cabinet. I'll see you tonight.
"
," Robin: And so the life of a television reporter is very rewarding, and I stronly urge you to consider it as a career. Thank you. Yeah?
"
," Robin: Oh, no, I don't have a fiancé.
"
," Robin: Well, actually, I've got five dogs.
"
," Robin: No, I've got five dogs.
"
," Robin: Well, yeah, that's cats. I'm not some pathetic cat lady. Not that your grandmother is...
"
," Robin: Does anyone else have a...? Yes?
"
," Robin: No. Are you? Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les...
"
," Robin: Ha-ha. Laugh now, those kids are monsters. They're going to eat you alive.
"
," Robin: Hello.
"
," Robin: Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.
"
," Robin: I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.
"
," Robin: No, and why does this keep coming up today?
"
," Robin: What? Oh, no, that was Beatrice. He's just a friend. I mean, there was this moment where we almost dated, but we want completely different things. Anyway, now he has this girlfriend in Germany and he thinks she's calling to dump him tonight, but I don't think she is. And besides, we want completely different things.
"
," Robin: What?
"
," Robin: Well, moving past the horrifying image of your hair helmet clanging against the headboard, don't get involved with people I work with.
"
," Robin: Hey, guys. Miss me? I missed you, too. Hi, Lance, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over? Lance?
"
," Robin: Do you want to come over?
"
," Robin: Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like, ""You know who likes juice? Joann.""
"
," Robin: Great. So you want to come over and make juice?
"
," Robin: Yes, we'll juice.
"
," Robin: Okay... bye.
"
," Robin: Hi.
"
," Robin: Or we could just drink wine.
"
," Robin: Thanks.
"
," Robin: Sure.
"
," Robin: Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore or what the hell you're doing with your life? Do you ever have one of those days?
"
," Robin: I don't know, it was just a, a rough day and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you. So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?
"
," Robin: What?
"
," Robin: Oh, Brittany, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful.
"
," Robin: Am I? No I'm not. I'm a news anchor. Smiling's a part of the job. Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today. See? You're smiling, too.
"
," Robin: Oh, yeah. Do you like it?
"
," Robin: Wow. Weird.
"
," Robin: I'll be here.
"
," Robin: Hey.
"
," Robin: Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.
"
," Robin: Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.
"
," Robin: Good night, Marc.
"
," Robin: Oh, my God. We're making out.
"
," Robin: This is crazy.
"
," Robin: Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...
"
," Robin: Yeah?
"
," Robin: Okay.
"
," Robin: Okay. Bye. (She hungs up) I thought it was mine, so I answered it.
"
," Robin: It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.
"
," Robin: Well, whatever you do, do not name your baby ""Becky,"" right?
"
," Robin: Becky. My new co-anchor? Don't you guys ever watch the show?
"
," Robin: Peace talks in the region have been described as, ""productive."" Becky?
"
," Robin: Becky, we're-we're journalists. We can't get emotional about the news, we...
"
," Robin: Well, if you read the story, we might find out.
"
," Robin: Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky?
"
," Robin: You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men?
"
," Robin: Okay, uh, let me get this straight. So, in, uh, in this scenario, because you make such sweet love to Mason, she is now your daughter.
"
," Robin: Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy.
"
," Robin: No.
"
," Robin: Members of the G-8 convened today in Vienna to discuss plans to fight climate change by re... What?
"
," Robin: Hey, Becky, Becky, this is our news segment, okay? Nobody cares what you did yesterday.
"
," Robin: Mike!
"
," Robin: Okay, back to the G-8 conference. Hello? Mike, can I get in the shot? Fantastic.
"
," Robin:Wait-- did you go out with Dale Mosby?
"
," Robin:In other news, later today, a Manhattan architect gets punched in the throat.
"
," Robin: Naomi, of all the women in New York, you had to go out with an eight-year-old girl?
"
," Robin: Theodore, you know that I hate her. How could you go out on a date with this girl?
"
," Robin: Let me guess: she acted like a helpless little girl, and you stepped in as the big, strong man.
"
," Robin: Wait. Is that why you slept on the couch last night?
"
," Robin: Yeah, we don't care about this...
"
," Robin: Oh, but you find it irresistible when Becky does? I don't get it. The Clifton that I went out with was attracted to the kind of woman who could use a steak knife without supervision.
"
," Robin: Needed? (scoffs) She makes training wheels feel needed.
"
," Robin: When we were dating, I... I didn't make you feel needed?
"
," Robin: I got this.
"
," Robin: I got this. Whoa!
"
," Robin: I got this.
"
," Robin: Did that really bother you?
"
," Robin: I got this.
"
," Robin: Hey.
"
," Robin: Hey. Um, when we were dating, did... did I make you feel needed?
"
," Robin: That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry.
"
," Robin: Thanks, Dustin. You know, um... there's something that I wanted to ask you, and I don't really know how to say it so... here goes. Who's the crazy chick in the apron?
"
," Robin: I got this.
"
," Robin: Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore.
"
," Robin: Wait, hot-crazy scale?
"
," Robin: No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Sebastian and I are not together. No. No.
"
," Robin: Yeah.
"
," Robin: College, good times.
"
," Robin: Uh, no, but I would love to buy one of them if... Where can I get one?
"
," Robin: Look, there's nothing going on between me and Same.
"
," Robin: No, I'm just saying you don't have anything to worry about.
"
," Robin: No, I'm saying that you shouldn't be.
"
," Robin: A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about s*x, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Gladys is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?
"
," Robin: You wanna hang out?
"
," Robin: Yeah man, you've been a rock.
"
," Robin: Why?
"
," Robin: Ok, how about Hurley's?
"
," Robin: It's that thing?
"
," Robin: The sea is blue.
"
," Robin: What?
"
," Robin: She turns around.
"
," Robin: Who is Gazeur?
"
," Robin: You did what?
"
," Robin: Clearing the air, as before. Oh, man. It does not happen often. You are welcome.
"
," Robin: Who is Becca Delucci?
"
," Robin: Not me.
"
," Robin: If the last person I wanted to see, came in I would not talk to him.
"
," Robin: My father.
"
," Robin: I have not spoken to him in 3 years and I want to start now.
"
," Robin: It goes back to my birth.
"
," Robin: He wanted a son and the fact that I am a girl has not changed.
"
," Robin: My full name is Robin Charles Scherbatsky, Jr. And it only got worse.
"
," Robin: At 8, he took me hunting for the first time. I want to shoot a deer.
"
," Robin: But they're cute.
"
," Robin: My body started to change...
"
," Robin: It was increasingly hard for him to act as if I was a boy.
"
," Robin: The worst moment came in my 14 years. My junior hockey team had just won the ""Squamish Invitational."" And everybody came to my house to celebrate.
"
," Robin: You're an idiot.
"
," Robin: And Kyle and I are doing anything serious. It was only the blue line.
"
," Robin: You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that ""crease"" speaks for itself. After that, my relationship with my father has cooled. I moved with my mother, let my hair grow, was a Canadian pop star. Young normal stuff.
"
," Robin: That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what? ""I wish not to be raised as a boy, that thou teach me not to hunt, fish and smoke cigars and drinking scotch because girls do not do that. And you know why I run like a girl? Because I am one. ""
"
," Robin: Yes.
"
," Robin: This is so exciting.
"
," Robin: I understand!
"
," Robin: Why take it away to bring him back in New Jersey, anyway?
"
," Robin: Get rid of your demons!
"
," Robin: Wow, it's beautiful, Pedro.
"
," Robin: But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?
"
," Robin: Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more.
"
," Robin: How do you play the harp with your belly so...?
"
," Robin: You only play half the harp?
"
," Robin: Oh, no. Uh, okay. Charles, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn?
"
," Robin: Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of ""Guitar Hero""? Learned that in a day. Is there a ""Harp Hero""?
"
," Robin: Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony.
"
," Robin: Really? That didn't work.
"
," Robin: Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?
"
," Robin: Why? Why would she do that?
"
," Robin: That is a good song.
"
," Robin: That's Scooter.
"
," Robin: Oh, wow.
"
," Robin: I have hairy nipples.
"
," Robin: No, but it worked, didn't it?
"
," Robin: There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call...
"
," Robin: Oh, no. Mathew, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry.
"
," Robin: Are you sure?
"
," Robin: Jeremy, are you okay?
"
," Robin: What happened to ""I don't want a perfect wedding""?
"
," Robin: And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better.
"
," Robin: Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you.
"
," Robin: Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here.
"
," Robin: He's gonna cry.
"
," Robin: Hey, I found your panties!
"
," Robin: Wow. First lie of marriage. That was fast.
"
," Robin: So, Claudia, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.
"
," Robin: Not according to her.
"
," Robin: How is that a disaster?
"
," Robin: Please, Cheese. You like this girl.
"
," Robin: Mia, you can't say her name without smiling.
"
," Robin: You like her. You should call her.
"
," Robin: That is ridiculous. Valerie, you know what, here's some advice.
"
," Robin: Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man.
"
," Robin: Good night. Good night, guys.
"
," Robin: Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and...
"
," Robin: Throw me one? Yeah.
"
," Robin: Oh, I see what's going on.
"
," Robin: This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your shot. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care.
"
," Robin: Nora met a guy. What?!
"
," Robin: Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.
"
," Robin: In other words, one-eighth the size of Canada. So...
"
," Robin: Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero.
"
," Robin: Sorry. Who said anything about an...?
"
," Robin: No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten.
"
," Robin: You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship.
"
," Robin: Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one.
"
," Robin: I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve.
"
," Robin: Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place.
"
," Robin: Damn it, Theresa, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, ""Yeah, Theresa, go get her!"" But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.
"
," Robin: It's a five, idiot.
"
," Robin: ""Moon man language""? What does that even mean?
"
," Robin: Look how you taped this up...
"
," Robin: Kathryn. Go get her.
"
," Robin: You say stuff pictures. Expect. You do not want it to look like a couple, right?
"
," Robin: It's so rude.
"
," Robin: Totally. It is a tightrope, but still.
"
," Robin: Of course it was me.
"
," Robin: Funny. Every year my mother took tea with her friend Easter Bell. Not so funny.
"
," Robin: It was there, we know the end.
"
," Robin: The funny for this photo. I plottait ass.
"
," Robin: Wait. Look at these pictures. Claudia always has the same pose and all these years.
"
," Robin: It's gotta be a lousy picture of you.
"
," Robin: And in elementary school? We all have school pictures ugly.
"
," Robin: A crisp, Roberto?
"
," Robin: I! A photo ugly.
"
," Robin: No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips?
"
," Robin: This is what happened in Paris?
"
," Robin: It's terrible. My laptop is just... fell. You me collected?(Mark looks to pick it up) Mouse, m*therf*cker! I!
"
," Robin: Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing!
"
," Robin: I'm sorry, Wesley. I agree with Ronnie on this. This kind of evening is hard for someone new. That's why I have not brought Don. When I was in Japan, this guy, hot date for our third, took me to his brother's wedding. Now I, a complete stranger, am on the photo album of the marriage of a Japanese couple forever.
"
," Robin: I'm starting to cry.
"
," Robin: And you got me pinched cheeks very hard for them to be pink.
"
," Robin: And then we all ate chocolate cake in my bed.
"
," Robin: I think Lori's age made him very wise.
"
," Robin: It's a hole in your jacket?
"
," Robin: sh1t!
"
," Robin: Yes!
"
," Robin: Well, Derek and I just broke up.
"
," Robin: Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed.
"
," Robin: Thanks, I feel a lot better. Think I'll get that drink now.
"
," Robin: Well, makes sense.
"
," Robin: Ooh, 'plus one', you make it sound so romantic. Jorge: Fine. You wanna be my date?
"
," Robin: Your date? I'd love to. Um, how fancy are we talking about here?
"
," Robin: Oh, I'll bring it. I'll bring it so hard the bride's gonna look like a big white bag of crap.
"
," Robin: Lydia, I need a dress.
"
," Robin: I know, it's a suicide mission.
"
," Robin: (from inside apartment) Just a second.
"
," Robin: Well, did I bring it? Or did I bring it?
"
," Robin: I think I brought it.
"
," Robin: That's what I was going for. I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're gonna have so much fun.
"
," Robin: Leona. Where's Julio? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought.
"
," Robin: Oh, OK, well I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Randy's gonna love them.
"
," Robin: Bye-bye.
"
," Robin: Wow yourself. Look who else brought it.
"
," Robin: Sorry.
"
," Robin: Hello. Oh my God, tonight? You're kidding. Robin: (to Gregory) They want me to anchor the news tonight.
"
," Robin: Really? Like, anchor anchor? What happened to Sandy? OK, OK, sure, what time do you need me to...Right now! Oh.
"
," Robin: OK, I need like five minutes to change and um, I'll call you from the cab...
"
," Robin: Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break.
"
," Robin: Dibs on his wings!
"
," Robin: Oh, hey guys, hey Ranjit.
"
," Robin: Nuh, it's scotch.
"
," Robin: Hhhhh Don.
"
," Robin: Now that's what I call having a woof over your head. Don. DON?
"
," Robin: He asked me out.
"
," Robin: Well we were on the air, I was on the spot, so I said OK.
"
," Robin: What? Nooo I HATE Don. And now I can't cancel because I said I would go out with him on the air.
"
," Robin: Getting drunk and cleaning the apartment was a plan?
"
," Robin: Oh but we're not even like going out for dinner, we're just hanging out at his place.
"
," Robin: No, it's not like that. It's just us and a bunch of other people.
"
," Robin: Errrrrrr...I... OK.
"
," Robin: Err, of course he asked me out.
"
," Robin: Yes, he did. He did. He did. He DID!
"
," Robin: Whaaat?!! (in a high voice) (huffs) Nooo, I HATE Don! I-I-I can't stop thinking how much I hate him, it's like, it's like... all the time. I just wanna attack him and rip his stupid clothes off and spank him with his little paddle until his bum's all red. SHUT UP!! (leaves the table)
"
," Robin: I do not love Don.
"
," Robin: Yeah I got to agree. Duck's up, rabbit down.
"
," Robin: You wrap yourself in a comforter stuffed with rabbit hair. (almost yells) I wrap myself in one stuffed with duck feathers. Who's cosier? No, no, no, no, no, no... who's cosier?
"
," Robin: Say it.
"
," Robin: YAYYYYY.
"
," Robin: Thank you. And Don is, and always will be, a rabbit.
"
," Robin: Hey, Pamela?
"
," Robin: Before you go meet your future wife, why don't you swing by Don's party with me?
"
," Robin: Yeah, why?
"
," Robin: They're not gonna get...
"
," Robin: Ha ha ha. It's not gonna get happen... but yeah, do that!
"
," Robin: Come... god, Don, what the hell are you doing?
"
," Robin: Yeah, cause I would never, could like, standards, so... you know... I thought this was a party.
"
," Robin: Wanda's not my date. He's a friend.
"
," Robin: (sees Don with imaginary rabbit's ears) You could say that.
"
," Robin: Brad, this may hurt a little, I'm recycling your old Architecture Weekly magazines.
"
," Robin: Cleaning. You go on your date. Happy Valentine's Day.
"
," Robin: You go on your date. Happy Valentine's Day.
"
," Robin: Darryl! Come on. Big date.
"
," Robin: I know. So much running around and freaking out. For what?
"
," Robin: Well, the joke's on the rest of the world cause we can do that on our own.
"
," Robin: Exactly.
"
," Robin: Save it. Let's just do the news.
"
," Robin: Clearly.
"
," Robin: 12.
"
," Robin: You can... just look at your mug.
"
," Robin: Well, I'll believe that when I see it.
"
," Robin: Don!! You're wearing pants!
"
," Robin: (sees him with an imaginary duck's beak) Uh, duck!
"
," Robin: Is your favorite brand of dental floss poisoning your entire family? Tune in at 11:00 for the shocking... Tooth.
"
," Robin: Okay, I officially hate my job. I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who shows up at night and scares people. I'm the bogeyman with a teleprompter.
"
," Robin: Coming up next, is your local ice cream man actually driving a roving meth lab on wheels? Stay tuned for the full... Scoop. Really?
"
," Robin: You called, said..., and hung up. What do you want?
"
," Robin: Fine.
"
," Robin: Did you just ask me about about my period?
"
," Robin: Look, Natalie, I'm at work right now.
"
," Robin: What?
"
," Robin: Why are you acting like this?
"
," Robin: You're being super nice. It's... freaking me out. Be... gross, be inappropriate. Be Leslie.
"
," Robin: Right. So I went to the chiropractor yesterday. That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour.
"
," Robin: That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man.
"
," Robin: Who are you?
"
," Robin: Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?
"
," Robin: There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply.
"
," Robin: Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel.
"
," Robin: It's not as easy...
"
," Robin: I promise.
"
," Robin: To taking chances.
"
," Robin: Yeah, why not? Hold that thought?
"
," Robin: April, have... you met Brett? April just finished her shift, she's looking to blow off some steam.
"
," Robin: You were so nice to me tonight, I wanted to return the favor, wingwoman-style. So, as I was saying, Jordan is the Yankees' new second-baseman. And Jordan, April asked if tomorrow, you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match. You can't make this stuff up. So, you two kids have fun.
"
," Robin: George will take the envelope of cash I gave him and head straight into our trap.
"
," Robin: Meanwhile, I'll make sure
"
," Robin: I'm sorry, Jill, but I have a chance to Don. And I will not drink out with you every night... especially when ""you"" included two of my ex.
"
," Robin: You too. I gotta go. It is called? (She hangs up) Sorry, New York, I had to answer. Where were we? Bus accident.
"
," Robin: Sorry, someone had to. I pay my tour.
"
," Robin: Oh, I don't know. Probably hanging out with Mike, this guy I've been seeing.
"
," Robin: No, I mean, he's not my boyfriend. He's just this guy I've been seeing for a couple of weeks.
"
," Robin: We're not really ready to go public yet.
"
," Robin: I don't know, we were kinda thinking about staying at home and dressing up as naked people.
"
," Robin: Hey, Carmen, what are you doing for Halloween?
"
," Robin: What?
"
," Robin: What's the Slutty Pumpkin?
"
," Robin: Wait, how can a pumpkin costume be sexy?
"
," Robin: Hey, Chad, how's it hanging?
"
," Robin: (to Edith as he walks by her out the door) Whoo.
"
," Robin: (to Warren) Nice outfit.
"
," Robin: You sure are.
"
," Robin: He's meeting me here. I ran late covering the Halloween parade in the Village. There are like a zillion gay pirates this year.
"
," Robin: Uh, you know, Mike and I joked about doing something together but we decided not to dress up.
"
," Robin: Oh, geez.
"
," Robin: Ah, everyone, this is Michael. Th-that is not his real hair.
"
," Robin: You thought I was...Oh, I was just kidding. I gotta stop making jokes in e-mails. It's so hard to convey tone.
"
," Robin: Actually I kinda need this hand to eat.
"
," Robin: This cheeseburger is so...
"
," Robin: Oh, well, that's good. I'm OK, thanks.
"
," Robin: I'm just really feeling this cheeseburger.
"
," Robin: Dude, I'm kind of in the zone here.
"
," Robin: So, do you like Mike?
"
," Robin: Of course I do. Why?
"
," Robin: Ah, Carmen, you know me, I'm just not into all that couple-y stuff.
"
," Robin: Are you trying to get me to join a cult?
"
," Robin: What?
"
," Robin: OK, what am I supposed to do? Buy him a giant teddy bear or something?
"
," Robin: I can share dessert. He better want the brownie sundae, but yeah, yeah, I can totally share.
"
," Robin: A little to the left, Christian. Tom, squat down.
"
," Robin: Got it.
"
," Robin: Wow, this sundae looks so good I could eat the whole thing.
"
," Robin: But, um, I would much rather share this small, one-scoop sundae with you, Mike.
"
," Robin: Well, let's dig in, Mi... Mi... Microwave Oven.
"
," Robin: No, you found it. I came with you. Go on.
"
," Robin: I cannot get enough of it.
"
," Robin: I'm crazy and you're crazy for tiramisu.
"
," Robin: No, no, no, I mean it just sounds a little bit weird, doesn't it? We love tiramisu. Is it really a group activity, loving tiramisu? Right?
"
," Robin: See there, hungry.
"
," Robin: Hey, is that Gary Oldman? (pointing behind Mike and Leslie)
"
," Robin: Brain freeze.
"
," Robin: Wanna drink the melty part?
"
," Robin: Hey, I thought we were gonna follow those bread crumbs back to my place, Hansel
"
," Robin: I like being with you.
"
," Robin: Well, who uses ink? Sorry. OK, I'm a bit set in my ways. That doesn't mean that this won't work.
"
," Robin: Wait, are we breaking up?
"
," Robin: Seriously it's not a big deal. He wanted to be a 'we,' and I wanted to be an 'I'. Dudes are such chicks. You guys, I'm fine.
"
," Robin: You guys, let me get a picture.
"
," Robin: I had a feeling I'd find you here.
"
," Robin: I never played any team sports
"
," Robin: I played tennis in high school. You know why? Because it was just me out there. I couldn't even stand playing doubles. I just got dumped.
"
," Robin: Yeah, it's OK. I wasn't that into him. Story of my life. Everyone else is all falling in love and acting stupid and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me. Why don't I want that more? I want to want that. Am I wired wrong or something?
"
," Robin: Well, what if I'm just a cold person? Tonight, Mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but I couldn't be Gretel. Why can't I be Gretel?
"
," Robin: Really?
"
," Robin: How do you do this, Pearl? How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up.
"
," Robin: Scoot.
"
," Robin: How many of those have you eaten?
"
," Robin: Oh, Clarady boy.
"
," Robin: All right, here's what you do: Put together a care package of stuff from New York-- some H&H bagels, an Empire State Building keychain... and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready? From three days ago.
"
," Robin: That is funny.
"
," Robin: Okay, fine, I have feelings for him.
"
," Robin: The irony is clear, Lucille.
"
," Robin: So, did she get the awesome care package yet?
"
," Robin: Did she love it?
"
," Robin: So what's the problem?
"
," Robin: Oh, Teresady boy.
"
," Robin: It's pretty clear.
"
," Robin: Totally what I was thinking. Get out of my head, man!
"
," Robin: I cut off all my fingers? Brennan, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it. I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident. I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you.
"
," Robin: I'd wait.
"
," Robin: Hello.
"
," Robin: Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.
"
," Robin: I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. She's not going to break up with you, Roger. You're awesome.
"
," Robin: Hi, Lisa. It's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but, uh, do you want to come over?
"
," Robin: My career. This is my new priority. From now on, more a date. The job.
"
," Robin: My book? Buddy... in two volumes, right here.
"
," Robin: So, I have told you, I take a break on that side.
"
," Robin: What?
"
," Robin: It's unlikely, I focus on my career, finished the rencards.
"
," Robin: It's good but...
"
," Robin: I answer? It's good for them...
"
," Robin: It's his life. These girls had it coming if they are stupid enough to be fooled.
"
," Robin: If you fall in there, you break my heart, but sorry, you're sdébile.
"
," Robin: I'll fetch the newspaper.
"
," Robin: You must stop, seriously. The last thing I'm looking for now is a relationship.
"
," Robin: Thousands?
"
," Robin: What happened?
"
," Robin: I'm leaving.
"
," Robin: Sorry to interrupt but check it out.
"
," Robin: I did not worship the book.
"
," Robin: We just broke. The costumes are nice, but... it just broke.
"
," Robin: It's okay. It's hard for me too. Look at me. I gave up on relationships.
"
," Robin: I'll knock your heads like two coconuts.
"
," Robin: It's a good guy.
"
," Robin: It's nothing.
"
," Robin: It says what?
"
," Robin: I will not fall in love with him.
"
," Robin: No comment. The blue jacket, it does not suit me, so...
"
," Robin: I will work.
"
," Robin: I'm really going to work.
"
," Robin: Yes.
"
," Robin: Damn, Juan.
"
," Robin: Oh, geez, Clifford, don't do this.
"
," Robin: You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.
"
," Robin: And here come the paramedics.
"
," Robin: Maybe she really does have a brain injury.
"
," Robin: Oh, yes, you do.
"
," Robin: Need a ride, cowboy?
"
," Robin: Hmm, too bad. I got candy.
"
," Robin: So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?
"
," Robin: Oh, come on.
"
," Robin: Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights.
"
," Robin: Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took ""highlights"" to mean, ""I want to look like a tiger,"" hence the hat.
"
," Robin: No way.
"
," Robin: So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?
"
," Robin: Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.
"
," Robin: I read that. More like ""Love in the Time of Don't Bothera.""
"
," Robin: We're not indoors. We're in a van.
"
," Robin: Never. What else?
"
," Robin: Barf.
"
," Robin: What else?
"
," Robin: And she's looking to get married and have kids?
"
," Robin: Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids.
"
," Robin: You know, Jack, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8:56. You're early.
"
," Robin: Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for.
"
," Robin: All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.
"
," Robin: Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.
"
," Robin: Go.
"
," Robin: And then there was Derek and counting you, that puts the total up to...
"
," Robin: Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?
"
," Robin: Why?
"
," Robin: No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.
"
," Robin: All right, I'm in.
"
," Robin: Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going.
"
," Robin: I just don't feel like going to a mall.
"
," Robin: No, I'm really not gonna go.
"
," Robin: No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls.
"
," Robin: I'd rather not say.
"
," Robin: Thanks Michael.
"
," Robin: You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to.
"
," Robin: No.
"
," Robin: Gabriella.
"
," Robin: Let it go.
"
," Robin: Let it go. And who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Ruby: Not me in Ohio when I was nine, that's for sure.
"
," Robin: I used to be a dude.
"
," Robin: A friend of mine in Canada got married way too young and it really turned her off to marriage.
"
," Robin: Oh, I like it. Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada who got married too young? Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Field's giant cookie.
"
," Robin: My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.
"
," Robin: There's no 'p' in husband.
"
," Robin: Huh.
"
," Robin: Are you asking me if I'm married? Bobbie: You can ask me. Nope, I'm not married. Your turn.
"
," Robin: What happened to respecting my privacy? Antonio: Just say, ""no, I'm not married.""
"
," Robin: Cassandra, I don't understand why you can't...
"
," Robin: I can't. Darren's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married.
"
," Robin: He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough.
"
," Robin: I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this.
"
," Robin: Thanks Katherine.
"
," Robin: I say we just move on.
"
," Robin: Um...
"
," Robin: No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc.
"
," Robin: String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.
"
," Robin: Dusty rose and sienna.
"
," Robin: Um.
"
," Robin: Yes I was.
"
," Robin: How do you know?
"
," Robin: What library?
"
," Robin: When did you go?
"
," Robin: I'm not questioning the lunch part, Jessie. What database did you use?
"
," Robin: You told Wanda?
"
," Robin: See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret.
"
," Robin: Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too.
"
," Robin: Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Gabe my biggest secret in the world?
"
," Robin: Yeah, but it could have been.
"
," Robin: He moved there for business.
"
," Robin: I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.
"
," Robin: What?
"
," Robin: Rosemary, don't, okay.
"
," Robin: No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it.
"
," Robin: I wanna stress that I was young.
"
," Robin: And I didn't know any better.
"
," Robin: And it started out as an innocent modeling job.
"
," Robin: What the hell was that?
"
," Robin: p0rn? I wish it was p0rn, it would be less embarrassing.
"
," Robin: I was a teenage pop star in Canada.
"
," Robin: Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.
"
," Robin: The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93.
"
," Robin: No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?
"
," Robin: Good call.
"
," Robin: You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice.
"
," Robin: Camila! All we need is your indoor ""whoo.""
"
," Robin: Nelson's awesome.
"
," Robin: We're just not feeling it right now. But we'll totally still be friends.
"
," Robin: Oh no, no, no. God, no. Mabel, it's not you. It's us.
"
," Robin: OK, I should get going. I got a date.
"
," Robin: Even better, seeing him naked.
"
," Robin: Slow your roll there, Elsiepad.
"
," Robin: Ok, It's like this. After we kissed, we sat down to have the talk.
"
," Robin: We should figure out what this is.
"
," Robin: Okay, now, we have to figure this out.
"
," Robin: We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk.
"
," Robin: Yeah, we knew you would say that. That's why we kept it a secret.
"
," Robin: Euh, oh, hum, heu...
"
," Robin: Come on, Brad, that's... Wow, There's really six of them. But, I can't.
"
," Robin: No. No, no boyfriend.
"
," Robin: You're probably wondering why I've been quiet all night.
"
," Robin: Damn it, Hordichuk! You miss another gimme like that, I'm gonna come down there and put a slapper right up your beerhole! Come on!
"
," Robin: The truth is, I feel kind of weird being out with you.
"
," Robin: What?
"
," Robin: No, Brad, no, it's...
"
," Robin: God, no... Brad, no... This is about me and Linda.
"
," Robin: Well, we don't know what we are. I mean, my heart says ""leap into it."" My brain says ""it's a bad idea.""
"
," Robin: Why not? Lay it on me.
"
," Robin: That's putting it a bit strongly.
"
," Robin: A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay?
"
," Robin: We've been over this. Unless I say ""flugelhorn"" you haven't gone too far.
"
," Robin: Right. Look, don't even worry about it. It's...
"
," Robin: God. The doorknob's broken off. We're locked in here. Did, did you do this?
"
," Robin: Flugelhorn. Did you do this?
"
," Robin: (knocking at the door) Kurt, are you out there?
"
," Robin: Byron, let us out of here.
"
," Robin: Julie! Come on. Let us out!
"
," Robin: You're gonna lock us in here? Well, guess what? Maybe we'll spend the whole day having s*x!
"
," Robin: (from her room) Nice job, Zoe.
"
," Robin: Not cool!
"
," Robin: (to Jessie) Dude, I'm starving. Let's... Let's just have the stupid talk. Come on.
"
," Robin: (reading) Where do you see this relationship going? My God, that sounds so cheesy.
"
," Robin: Totally. But hum... Where do you see this relationship going?
"
," Robin: Mad? I feel the same way. I suck at relationships. I mean, except with Melvin. He really got it right. I know it's a cliché, but... he really ruined me for other men.
"
," Robin: Maybe. But hum... I don't want to stop having s*x.
"
," Robin: Friends isn't gonna work.
"
," Robin: I know something we're good at.
"
," Robin: No,not that. Lying. Think about it. We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends. Why not just keep lying?
"
," Robin: Really. We sat down. We had the talk. Leslie's my boyfriend now.
"
," Robin: We're both afraid of commitment but... the fact is, we also can't live without each other.
"
," Robin: And he's awesome. He looks nice in a suit.
"
," Robin:  He's my boyfriend.
"
," Robin: (leaving the building) She bought it.
"
," Robin: Totally. So, you want to get some breakfast?
"
," Robin: Well, lead the way, sweetie pie.
"
," Robin:  Yeah, that felt wrong.
"
," Robin: I was just so uptight in New York, you know? I mean, down here everybody shares everything. It's like we're all one big shimmering ball of positive energy. I wonder if anyone's ever thought that before.
"
," Robin: A drum circle! They're different every time. Let's go watch!
"
," Robin: And here I am at the drum circle.
"
," Robin: Oh, it was. I feel like the Robin who left is not the same Robin who came back, you know.
"
," Robin: Thank you.
"
," Robin: I'm evolved, and I'm enjoying living my life a little bit closer to the way Gael and I did in Argentina.
"
," Robin: My journey was transformative and I reassert my commitment to both the aforementioned paramour and the philosophies he espouses.[/b]
"
," Robin: Mmm.
"
," Robin: Yeah. It's great. Amazing, fantastic, awesome.
"
," Robin: Well, now that I'm home, I'm finding myself getting annoyed at things that I loved on vacation.
"
," Robin: Oh, so good.
"
," Robin: Ooh sofa! Ooh sofa! Sofa, sofa, oh... ooh (she grunts)
"
," Robin: Ooh.
"
," Robin: Laptop! Laptop! Laptop! (She sighs when the laptop fall over)
"
," Robin: And you know what else? I'm still finding sand everywhere. I mean, we haven't been to the beach since Argentina. Where is all coming from?
"
," Robin: But I don't want to. I was so happy down there. No, you know what? I'm done complaining. I'm evolving. Just gonna go with the flow.
"
," Robin: Wow. Gael, you're peeing while I'm in the shower. Okay. Okay, old Robin would have been like, dude, ocupado. But now, you know what, I'm cool with it. Pee it up. In fact, when you're done, why won't you come in here and join me?
"
," Robin: Gael, there's some weird du.. (A lot of people is on her apartment) Hello.
"
," Robin: Quick announcement. I am so glad that you're here, fellow travelers. A couple rules... not even rules. Let's call them guidelines for harmonious living. Guideline for harmonious living number one ; The kitchen sink is for dishes, the toilet is for pee-pee. G.F.H.L. number two ; Marijuana is illegal in the United States, even when baked into a blueberry muffin that someone might mistakenly eat for breakfast right before they leave for their job as a TV Newscaster. ""This just in: Look at my hand, how weird is my hand?"" is not an appropriate thing to say on the air. And number three... I... (All cherring). (Yelling) And number three is please keep the noise to a minimum. I have to take a nap. I'm still pretty baked.
"
," Robin: Can you please keep it down?
"
," Robin: Well. I have to have a job.
"
," Robin: I'm canadian. You know that.
"
," Robin: Wow. I just realized something.
"
," Robin: No, that you really suck. You're boring and lame and you're getting sand everywhere. Seriously, where is all the sand coming from? You're not the real me. All you are is me on vacation trying to get away from a break-up.
"
," Robin: What are you doing?
"
," Robin: All right, everyone out! I said everyone out!
"
," Robin: (yelling) I'm canadian!
"
," Robin: No, I'm not. Listen, Gael, I need to talk to you about something.
"
," Robin: Oh, good to be back. Although it's weird, vacation Robin popped into my dream again last night.
"
," Robin: This time we went all the way. Tell you one thing. She is maybe sandy but that chick knows what I like.
"
," Robin: What?
"
," Robin: We talk about a woman that Dora Stinson has worked. I vote for Narnia.
"
," Robin: You call your mother every day?
"
," Robin: Hi.
"
," Robin: What's that, Benjamin?
"
," Robin: Very good program.
"
," Robin: You do not like playing the son of Gloria?
"
," Robin: I know what it is. I am a presenter. But I had to accept a job on a morning show that starts at 4:30. I thought evolve much faster than that, you know? I'm almost 30 years.
"
," Robin: I have not had surgery.
"
," Robin: Wait. You wrote that we will have dinner?
"
," Robin: What kind?
"
," Robin: Come on, Leonard. You have no idea of the difficulty of getting a job beneath you. I really liked your tip on the bones of dinosaurs.
"
," Robin: Perfect. You see? Even in a role that you hate, you manage to love what you do.
"
," Robin: You think so?
"
," Robin: Thank you, Grant. You're pretty smart, you know that?
"
," Robin: The taxi is here.
"
," Robin: Who speaks it?
"
," Robin: I have one. Terminator.
"
," Robin: You hate me?
"
," Robin: Push yourself. I recorded The View. This problem and was unemployed and sleeping on the couch.
"
," Robin: Are not you aware? I am a presenter on CNN. And I have made gold a terrace overlooking Central Park. Get out of your ass's head, Gabriella.
"
," Robin: Okay, but you better not be as they stuck together when I cans on the roof. ""My ears. The neighbors called the cops.You almost hit me. ""
"
," Robin: Are you okay? You looked upset on the phone.
"
," Robin: Carolyn, it's horrible!
"
," Robin: What?
"
," Robin: You know what is huge? Michael's head. It is as big as a watermelon in late August. Michael's baby who is passing by?
"
," Robin: A lot of things in the helmet of the space of 50 years who serves as its head.
"
," Robin: I think it's just realistic.
"
," Robin: Of course for you, it is natural, you're practically already a father.
"
," Robin: Marilyn, thoughtful. You go out jokes father of super lame.
"
," Robin: You make us moral. Like when you broke your ship in a bottle.
"
," Robin: Shut up!
"
," Robin: And you do that thing that all fathers are with the waitresses.
"
," Robin: What? You're crazy. This is false.
"
," Robin: I do not want to bite.
"
," Robin: It comes down to one word: ""you"". Are you ready to put your dreams in the background? Back in college, taught art at the university? You have to concentrate on the project before starting Pamela Baby Project. Otherwise, you'll regret it forever.And it would be good neither for you nor for the baby. What is it?
"
," Robin: Well, and everything I said?
"
," Robin: And Karl who works all the time?
"
," Robin: But but Valerie Project!
"
," Robin: We had this debate, and this is the sock that makes you make the decision?
"
," Robin: Shut up, Dad.
"
," Robin: Babies are scary, OK? With their giant eyes. And seriously, the fontanelle? If there is a self-destruct button, at least, hide it where it will not accidentally press.
"
," Robin: Not a drop.
"
," Robin: That's why I have no children. We can not even taking his eyes for a second.
"
," Robin: They sit there with their stupid bottles. They cry. They vomit. That's why babies, it sucks.
"
," Robin: My psychosis? Whenever you hear the word ""kid"", you have two small Milk tasks on your shirt.
"
," Robin: Do not depict me as a monster for wanting to remain independent. In there is a lot of people who do not want it.
"
," Robin: I'll see if the toilet. I also want to bring you back buffer.
"
," Robin: You know what? I should find another place to sleep.
"
," Robin: Well.
"
," Robin: Dale is not there.
"
," Robin: thank you God. What?
"
," Robin: I have a permit for that. And the other thing is a gift.
"
," Robin: No. I do not know what she's doing there. It must have fallen into it. Bizarre!
"
," Robin: Or Janet put it there for fun. That bitch is stuffed. I took it.It's just... so cute. Sock.
"
," Robin: I know. One day, perhaps. When I'm 70. Science will catch me. I'm just... I'm lost right now. I'm unemployed, I live on a couch.
"
," Robin: Really?
"
," Robin: Thank you, Sandra. I have some ideas, so it will be one week, two large max.
"
," Robin: Look at these guys, individually. These geniuses are not childless by choice, my friend.
"
," Robin: Good night.
"
," Robin: I don't even believe it myself.
"
," Robin: When was the last time you were there?
"
," Robin: What?
"
," Robin: Where?
"
," Robin: Nicholas, this is a Chinese restaurant.
"
," Robin: And why is that girl checking you out?
"
," Robin: Come on, Jesus, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right?
"
," Robin: Come on, Hazel, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?
"
," Robin: You're going to the hospital?
"
," Robin: Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Daisy.
"
," Robin: So, are you gonna talk to Glen?
"
," Robin: Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it.
"
," Robin: Ooh, can I do it?
"
," Robin: Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff.
"
," Robin: Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.
"
," Robin: Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she!
"
," Robin: Dwight, why don't you just talk to him? He's your best friend.
"
," Robin: One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.
"
," Robin: A lemon law, like for cars.
"
," Robin: For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society.
"
," Robin: It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great.

," Robin: Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate.
"
," Robin: Hi.
"
," Robin: Thank you.
"
," Robin: It's a nice place. It's good to know the future has ribs.
"
," Robin: Just a second.
"
," Robin: Hello.
"
," Robin: Leave me alone.
"
," Robin: We're only just getting to know each other.
"
," Robin: Sorry.
"
," Robin: No, I would never do that. I don't wanna go anywhere. I'm all yours.
"
," Robin: Oh God, I'll be right there.
"
," Robin: Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go. My friend's been stabbed with a sword.
"
," Robin: No, I swear that was a real call. I just...Oh forget it.
"
," Robin: Is she OK?
"
," Robin: But you're totally...
"
," Robin: Marilyn, your apartment makes the best Shanghai dumplings.
"
," Robin: Wow.
"
," Robin: Aw.
"
," Robin: So...
"
," Robin: Yes, it is.
"
," Robin: Hi, Kay.
"
," Robin: Nothing.
"
," Robin: Hi. Have you met Allison?
"
," Robin: Think he'll actually let it go?
"
," Robin: Can I get a water please?
"
," Robin: Oh, God! Okay. Look, we have some... news.
"
," Robin: So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon.
"
," Robin: What's wrong?
"
," Robin: All right, let's run some interference.
"
," Robin: All right, let's get these two back to their table.
"
," Robin: Conga line.
"
," Robin: How's it go?
"
," Robin: Lame.
"
," Robin: Okay, so we're sitting there and the waiter comes over...
"
," Robin: Um, we didn't order champagne.
"
," Robin: Is an engagement ring.
"
," Robin: No, no, no, no, no. Rhonda, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no.
"
," Robin: This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here.
"
," Robin: What?
"
," Robin: Then whose is it?
"
," Robin: Wow. That was hilarious. I was like... what? Anyway.
"
," Robin: What the hell was what?
"
," Robin: I thought you were proposing to me.
"
," Robin: Vivan, you know how I feel about marriage.
"
," Robin: I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight?
"
," Robin: Then why is this an issue?
"
," Robin: Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go?
"
," Robin: So did you guys find anything to eat?
"
," Robin: Leslie, don't do this.
"
," Robin: Where do you see yourself?
"
," Robin: And I probably want to be in Argentina.
"
," Robin: Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Bill, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure.
"
," Robin: Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home?
"
," Robin: Yeah? And how did that work out for you?
"
," Robin: Well, come on, Ronnie, can you blame them?
"
," Robin: Argentina.
"
," Robin: Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there.
"
," Robin: No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does.
"
," Robin: So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?
"
," Robin: Oh, shut up.
"
," Robin: Aren't you?
"
," Robin: Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.
"
," Robin: Right? Right?
"
," Robin: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
"
," Robin: I don't know if I can do this to you.
"
," Robin: Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids.
"
," Robin: You know what I mean.
"
," Robin: Manuel, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies.
"
," Robin: Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to start having babies right this second. Do you have a...?
"
," Robin: Well, we probably shouldn't.
"
," Robin: Risk it?
"
," Robin: Come on, they're cutting the cake.
"
," Robin: Oh, Randy, I don't know if I can go again. That tuckered me out.
"
," Robin: Right. Okay, let me just go change, and we'll leave.
"
," Robin: That is crazy. I have a change of clothes and you don't. Suck it up.
"
," Robin: Yeah. We were all talk, weren't we?
"
," Robin: I don't want to have kids in Argentina.
"
," Robin: So where does that leave us?
"
," Robin: You stole a blue French horn for me.
"
," Robin: Nope.
"
," Robin: We decided not to say anything till after the wedding.
"
," Robin: But we're okay.
"
," Robin: Hi.
"
," Robin: Well, uh, I've been to a couple funerals, so I know my role: I'm Vice Girl. Whatever Neil needs to get through this day, I got it right here.
"
," Robin: Yeah, but doesn't Genesis's mom hate you--the fact that you two aren't very close?
"
," Robin: Really, guys? At a funeral?
"
," Robin: How?
"
," Robin: Outlet or USB?
"
," Robin: ""If""? Julie, the kids in that movie jumped into a painting and spent 15 minutes chasing a cartoon fox. ""Spoonful of sugar...""? Grow up.
"
," Robin: All that stuff was really nice!
"
," Robin: I've been known to locate certain objects from time to time.
"
," Robin: I got ya.
"
," Robin: How?
"
," Robin: What's wrong?
"
," Robin: You should listen to it. Just don't put too much pressure on it.
"
," Robin: The point is, last words are overrated.
"
," Robin: You heard right. (whispering: ) I'm getting a reputation. So, what you need, mama? Come here.
"
," Robin: Hey, stay hydrated.
"
," Robin: No, here's the awful part.
"
," Robin: You remembered my birthday!
"
," Robin: Whoa, they grow big out here.
"
," Robin: Judy, I...
"

"
," Robin: Hi, Dad.
"
," Robin: Edwin told you.
"
," Robin: Girls talk about everything.
"
," Robin: Length, resemblance to a historical figure, such as Winston Churchill... Yes, that's one of you. Girth, grooming...
"
," Robin: Duh. Of course there's a girl.
"
," Robin: Yeah, I-I think it is so cool that you started your own law firm.
"
," Robin: He said it's small, Ian, and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on.
"
," Robin: Let's order!
"
," Robin: Totally.
"
," Robin: You're acting like he has six months to live.
"
," Robin: Oh, come on! What about you men and your locker room talk?
"
," Robin: Not to mention classy.
"
," Robin: Yeah. That argument has no traction whatsoever.
"
," Robin: Uh, it looks disgusting.
"
," Robin: Oh, of course, because what woman doesn't like being slobbered on while some giant paws at her nether regions like Lenny from Of Mice and Men?
"
," Robin: More Cosmos?
"
," Robin: Wow, that is weird.
"
," Robin: Wow. So he's right there making you say all this, huh?
"
," Robin: That sounds real.
