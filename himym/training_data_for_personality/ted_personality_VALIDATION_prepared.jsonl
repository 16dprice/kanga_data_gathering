{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, guys, be cool.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And I don't know which one to go for.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. No, I don't know. They're old sorority sisters.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They're Kappas and I think I can score with one of them. I don't know which one and if I choose wrong, I lose 'em both.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, that's very complicated.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, somebody should lock you girls up.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (muttering to himself) I am never not wearing a suit again.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi Mom, how's dad's colon?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They are? Are you sure?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are you positive?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bye mom.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My mom.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, this college boyfriend, who, who won him?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? What, what were you guys gonna do but never did.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nobody cares, just say it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's a tricycle.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Arlene and I have this running joke that the first guy to actually pull this off would win the championship belt.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You actually bought a belt.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? No.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. Look, I gotta go. They're gonna think I inherited my dad's imaginary bathroom issues.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, are you guys leaving?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right, well...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Great, I have it right upstairs. It's in my apartment upstairs. Let's so upstairs.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's funny. I love that. You should tell more jokes at my apartment upstairs.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Got 'em.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, yes, but they are not here. They are somewhere else. We have total privacy because privacy is essential when you're listening to music.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's hilarious. You are hilarious. I'll go get it in my bedroom. The CD's in my bedroom. Bedroom.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is gonna be awesome.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are you guys doing here? I've got, I've got...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You guys need to get out of here right now. Please, take the fire escape.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD...Christian.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are you doing?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why, why?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let me get this straight. You're gonna trike block me? That is so petty. It's like you're...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Tom Petty. You're Tom Petty.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where's Martha?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Still looking for that CD, so...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What if I reimburse you for the boots, full retail?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, take it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wish me luck.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, I'm having a little trouble finding the CD.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Exactly.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's getting late, I'll get your coats.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  See? If a complete degenerate like Samantha choked, what chance do I have?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It won't?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ladies, couldn't find your coats but I did find tequila.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, wait wait, a remote control fire place? We don't have a remote control fire place.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why would I want to tire them out?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's 'cause I used to practice all the time on my grandmother.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why in God's name would I say that?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I was just thinking about this documentary I saw once about something called a supervolcano.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, what the hell.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Could happen at any time and obliterate all life on earth, which is why I live by three simple words. Don't postpone joy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll see you on the other side.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Some stories you tell, some stories you don't.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do you want to try long distance?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She's going to dump me!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why hasn't she called yet?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, yeah... Uh, hi, I'm here.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why? What's up?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I love juice.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, sure. I'll come over. We'll... juice.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bye.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is fine. This is totally fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I'm, uh, going over to this girl's house to make some juice.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it's not like that. We're juicing as friends. See, I have this girlfriend, I would never cheat on her. She lives in Germany. See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk. I still haven't heard from her. I don't know. Sorry to bug you with my problems. Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can just let me out right up here.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth. Okay, here's where I left off with the last guy. See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over to this other girl's house...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, relax, Jacob's just a friend.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, yes! Juice is perfectly harmless. In fact, it's healthy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I am not won... Okay, even if I am wondering that, it's only 'cause you put it in my head.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn it! Nothing's going to happen.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, okay. You want a second opinion? Fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. I need a ruling. Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but I'm on my way over to Kay's right now. She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, pick up. Damn it, Victoria, where are you? Pick up, pick up!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, thanks. Where are you? Why haven't you called?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. Why do I doubt that? Hello.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Brett, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nothing good ever...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dude, Ben and I are just friends. She doesn't even like me that way.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She-she likes me?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She likes me?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Keep the change.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You want to get out of the way?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, if you had just called me, I...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi. Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wine... not? Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Make it a big glass.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, how's it hanging?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, about once a week.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We broke up.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. Yeah, she finally called. We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is-- and then... she dumped me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're smiling.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. I have no idea what that's all about.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Was that Korean Elvis?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um... Actually... I'm at Pedro's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What do you expect from me? It's Ana. Victoria's great, but, it's Ana. I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes. First thing tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I hate how you're always right.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I should probably get going. It's pretty late. I'm sorry. I...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Can I call you tomorrow?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay. Good night, Priscilla.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right? Right?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Stop doing that.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What do you want from me? People break up. It happens.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's not ideal.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're right. I owe you a real breakup call. I'll call you tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why should I have to go home? You know, there's every chance Arthur's the woman I'm going to marry.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Noah. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This isn't my phone.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Was it...?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm gonna stop you right here, Clifton. You name a chubby white kid \"LeBron,\" and he's the one getting stuffed in the basketball hoop.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ooh.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I watched. Jamie insisted I confirm how \"awful\" Becky is, so last night I checked it out.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mmm... (muttering) I thought she was charming.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. That is disgusting.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mary, your list is entirely boy names. You do realize there's roughly a 50% chance of you having a daughter, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's not what it sounds like, folks.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ow!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not what it sounds like, folks.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It wasn't a date. She came over to the apartment looking for you.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Aww...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know if that's totally true.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's okay, little darlin'.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, hey, hey, hey. Spiders gotta die so trees can grow.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Then I held her tight and told her it was all gonna be okay. By the way, I think I only wounded the spider. It crawled off into my bedroom.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (scoffing) Yeah, I slept.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No one challenged you, so it wasn't really a challenge.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, I'm glad that's over. It was creepy watching Isobel talk like a little kid.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  For your information, Becky doesn't like steak, she likes pasghetti. Spaghetti. And more importantly, she makes me feel needed.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, it's nice to feel needed. And you know what? It's not a feeling guys get when they're with you.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on! You always took charge of everything.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This okay? Am I hurting y...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Someone's trying to break in-- call the cops.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, yeah. It's nice to be needed. Look, I'm sorry. (phone chimes) I didn't mean to upset you. It's Becky. Aw, she's trapped in a revolving door.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Shoe's untied. I got it. Yeah, this is over.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Everyone, this is Blah-blah.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was so magical.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She's gonna tell some bogus story about a cooking class because she's embarrassed we met online.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? There's no stigma anymore.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, she's gorgeous.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No she's not.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She's not even on the hot-crazy scale. She's just hot.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She's not crazy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know who else has a really cute story of how they met? Christina and Howard. You guys should tell that story right now.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Anybody'd be stressed out meeting new people. She's not crazy. Crazy generous maybe, buying us drinks.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know who else is friends with Ted? Grace. How did we meet? It's a good story, I'm gonna tell it right now. Uh, it was the first day of college.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what else is a good story, how Eli and I met. Eli, tell that story, right now. Please.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I'm sorry about that.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh man, I'm really sorry.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? Henry: I just made that up mid-pee. It worked on you, it's definitely gonna work on that blonde chick at the end of the bar. Unless you're a total idiot. What's your name?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Isaac: (laughs) Well played.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh right, hi.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm not wearing a suit.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (signing) I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (signing) My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sherry, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (signing) He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Hilda.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Their story is not as magical as it seems.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I can't, it's kind of a secret.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The night before Priscilla met Steve, there was this party.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, and in all these years Miriam and I have never spoken about it, so again, mum's the word, OK?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If he heard that, it would destroy him.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, come on, you wouldn't.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh no.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't think anyone wants to hear that story.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, that is the unabridged story of how Kurt and I met. How embarrassing. Who wants another round?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Katie, will you help us get the next round?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She knows about us, about how we really met.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, the real story.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ralph, come on.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Veronica, come on.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Layla, come on.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, we did.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? Too-much-tongue guy? I'm not surprised to hear that coming from unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes it was, at the freshman orientation party.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is Gabriella, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So we should make lots of Star Wars references around girls, that's what you're saying?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And you know that girl I made out with at the freshman orientation party?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm too-much-tongue guy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? Felecia: Yeah, I'm positive. And too-much-tongue guy was Colin O'Riley.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, it's really, it's a cool game.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You and me? No idea.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That was you?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So I am not too-much-tongue guy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That is a fat sandwich.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can't believe I used to be able to eat a whole sandwich by myself. Now it's like two bites and I am done.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where's my wife?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's funny when I think about it. I was sure that Stella was good. When she left me, I was so devastated. But you helped me overcome that. Now the hard part is over. I came out a little louder. You know, I do not think further of it. This is the work of time, I guess.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know. That's all I advance. A new chapter in my life begins today, and we'll celebrate. Here, we need two things.We need Kool and the Gang. It's time the jukebox!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It gauze?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Girls, I'm fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bobby, I'm fine! It is not necessary, and it is rather unhealthy. Sorry, ladies.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What do you want for dinner?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's OK.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It is between the 44th and Lex. Impossible.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It is near the gym Stella. We could cross. Everywhere else, it's going.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Stack between his office and dry cleaner. Sorry.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Two blocks from her mother's hairdresser.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of course. Look at this.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A reference card I made. A guide to places where you can meet Stella Zinman. The red areas: to avoid. White: OK.Blue: the sea\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, I avoid it. What is the problem? It goes like this.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, 'on', it is the people of the great state of Ohio. When life is hard, we take the pain and bury us. And if the pain goes, is buried pain over another. Why cope when you can avoid?All I have to do is to never see her again, and I will have a long happy life. So who wants to eat?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Super. Let's go.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not yet. Can we have almonds to the table?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well done, Gabe. This place looks cool. That you talked about?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh my God! Oh my God! OK, stay cool. We'll just have to manage it. Everyone... follow me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Think, think. Guys, stay there. I'll take a look. Michele will look.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She looks happy? She talked about me? I do not care.Where are the almonds?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let me go. You'd do the same if you were in this situation.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really, not one? Not even... Gazeur?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let's just eat here, if possible.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you. You have a daily special?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really, you hide from anybody? Not even... Becca Delucci?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where exactly in the north, Nathan?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You see? Are you afraid of Becca. Same is afraid of Gazeur. (Bessie head out from under the table) are still under the table.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God. That's it, and that's it, the style Ohio. The problem manifested itself. It has been avoided. It is a party.Here you can dine in peace...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How so?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You kept it for quite some time, eh?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It has returned to you.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll talk to him. (They go out from under the table, but Stella is gone) She's gone. I'll catch up.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There she is!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I see. It is two taxis right front. Not lose it, OK?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I will face it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bluntly.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I will say, \"Sorry it did not work. \"We will discuss in adults. She'll tell me his views and... I will listen. What I should have done more before.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on. There is no question of moving his arms, stomping feet and get angry. This is Stella and I finally communicating. Clearly, it was...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's his problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  In the name of all that is sacred...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe she goes to his office.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If she goes to her, why you go to...? Oh, my God. Tony lives in the city center. \"At home\" is Tony's apartment. She would move in with me in New Jersey and moved to town, Tony? The bitch!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have the balls too!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Me too!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's it. That's it!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know exactly what I say. (Ted comes out of the taxi) You chose the wrong guy. You chose the wrong guy. You did a very, very, very bad choice. What were you thinking? This guy? You kidding me? Have you learned anything these past 8 years? You'll be sorry. You know it? You'll be sorry, and you can do anything about it because it is too late. Anything you can do is start up your life miserable and disappointing that will never be as happy as it could be with me. Goodbye.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, I'm not there to pick you. I am here because I need to know that you know you've made the worst mistake of your life.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay. (Ted is still in the taxi) This is what I say.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The good Backstreet Boys?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What-what the hell happened to you?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? What can you do?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's crazy. Of course she will.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule: never marry anyone you've had a farting contest with.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dude, those guys are criminals.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Brent accidentally shaved part of his head.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Kristen's and your hair.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Ron comes and takes the toupee.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It totally does.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  In a bad way.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What happened to your shirt?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You gonna put another shirt on?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So do it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Brandon can officiate.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Please don't.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, I realize it's raining, but, come on, it's 2021. We can make cell phones that project holograms, but a light drizzle shuts down a whole airport?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey... There she is. Wow.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wendy the Waitress! I was just saying-- what are you doing here?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it's a cute story. Once upon a time...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Zoey was married to this super rich, super creepy guy called The Captain. So when Zoey and I became friends, I was careful not to cross any lines.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know, right? But then one day, Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight. He flipped out and demanded a divorce. And she was heartbroken. But after a little soul-searching, she ended up back in my and the rest, as they say, is history.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh. A little cold.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain. I mean this in a super manly way. That guy scares the panties off me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If it's really important to you, I will pick it up tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm worried about Gordon. He doesn't seem like himself lately.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Anyway, we should get going.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm here to...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Captain. I...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Pssh, nah...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Guys, I got a problem. I ran into The Captain.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes! Limit the search to guys with mustaches. Smart.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And that's the last time you saw her.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's damn good brandy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Captain... don't blame yourself.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Me. I'm the bad guy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn it! The box!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi, I'm here to pick up...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  To the study?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Know what?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, no, no, you can't fire him.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, yeah! And, you know, since, since it doesn't really matter who Zoey's dating now...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's me. You're welcome.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Listen, Zoey, I need to ask you something. Did I steal you?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So I'm the bad guy. Great.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If you say so.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. That's a pretty good omelet.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well. But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids. It's actually a funny story of how we met. I was a best man at this wedding...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, well, have a safe trip. It was great seeing you. (Ted phones Willard) Hello. Willard.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey. You will not believe who I just ran into.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Happy Birthday! Here is Amanda.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Amanda will make a cake for Ross. She is head. We met at the restaurant last week when I returned my soup. Fortunately, she has such beautiful hair it not bother me a bit to eat.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Natalie is a teacher. Hence the \"students\".\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Debbie saw The Goonies just after his parents separated. After that, she had real problems of trust.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, I'll find Amanda.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait... You do not want Amanda on the picture, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Anita, what's the matter?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Tell me the truth.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Vincent, what are you talking?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's not true.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's Pap Pa......\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I remember, this is Sarah.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Normal if it is good guitarist.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Alma, sorry for Amanda. But I'll say. You make your spoiled rotten. You in all your statements because you think I messed up two three photos?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm so excited you're here.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? Because I think I want to tell you the same thing.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I feel sorry for Paris and group photos ruined, but... when you're single, you must hope that every girl is good. I mean, Erin.Irene.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And Sarah.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  At the time, I thought each of these girls could be good, but I have to keep hoping. I have no choice.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Because Eddie is your best friend.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Your best friend on Earth.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Before being your best friend, what was she? That's it. One of my random sluts.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I bring these girls to party because you are important. You are my family.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Here's the disgusting smelly hippie with whom I go out.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I did not say that!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Here's Framboise.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. Raspberry does not eat.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I confess. Raspberry was a mistake. But how would I know?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If this is so important, Amanda is not in the picture. It does not spoil your birthday. Give him a chance.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Amanda refuses to return. She thinks you hate it. Anthony, you have to go apologize.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are you talking?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry that my search for love has you so upset. You know, your precious photos might be better if I was not over.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what these pictures? A big lie. We ask. They are retouched. They are what you want but not the reality.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh? Look at that one. Halloween, there is 2 years old. You had not played because you wanted to disguise yourself as a penguin.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And yet you're there, smiling as if nothing was wrong, completely wrong. Ray's birthday, there is 3 years old. Ray had a cold, and you made him remove his pajamas for the photo.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, that was good.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do you remember what happened?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, we take what poses? The two cops friends?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And if you came to ask us?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And if you break it?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I liked you.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you, Lil.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Zack, try this. Keep your eyes closed until the last second and when I say, open them.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Now, Lester!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ann has...? Anna?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date, a $200 piece of chicken-slash-salmon will go uneaten. I gotta bring someone, but who?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, guys, I gotta say something. I think my feelings for Camila may be resurfacing.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture. Fact.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Rita was into me when we first met. Fact.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof. Fact.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  On New Year's Eve, we kissed again. Fact.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship is to celebrate someone else's successful one.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, with that mind, our friends Claudia and Stuart are having this crazy, black-tie wedding on Saturday. You wanna be my 'plus one'?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, you're gonna wanna bring your A game.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whoa, did you see how fired up she was? I don't know, there's something there. And come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne. Who knows? Jo: Wow, Ted, you're gonna have to find another gender for yourself 'cause I'm revoking your dude membership.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Claudia!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, how's it going? Claudia: My wedding's in two days, that's how it's going.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, don't worry, it's gonna be great. I'm so excited.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, well, yeah, I'm bringing a date, so I'll be off the market.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, yes I am.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I checked 'plus one'.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But I already invited someone.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But I checked 'plus one'. I always check 'plus one'.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She doesn't need a place card, she knows her name.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, Claudia, we go way back. Isn't there room for just one more person?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I did.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh great, here comes the 'little Jo' speech.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Please stop. I gotta call Claudia. If I just explain to her...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Then what am I gonna do?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, listen.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Seth's there's a problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, about that.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't have a 'plus one' for the wedding.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I ran into Claudia and she told me I didn't check 'plus one' on the reply card.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I did check 'plus one'.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We can't sneak her in, we're not ninjas.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Can I do that?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, it's gonna be a tough sell.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? Stuart: Sure, the more the merrier.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, wow, thanks for being so cool about this 'cause you know Claudia said...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, she's not usually like that.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, thanks, Stu, it's gonna be a great wedding.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I did it. I did it. I'm taking her to the wedding.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I talked to Stuart.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's Claudia.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, it can't be that bad.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Here, Travis, you answer it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Because this whole thing was your idea. And Claudia scares me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's not because of me, is it?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's Paula.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, Cindy's phone.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, Francis's busy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's great. I'll tell Mae to tell me. Uh, listen, I really wanna keep talking but now's not a good time so, um, I'm really excited about tomorrow. OK, bye.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this. Do you think she's into me?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I feel terrible.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Tell Claudia I'm sorry. Did she seem pissed at me?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Stuart, I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's crazy. I mean, you're the luckiest...you and Claudia both...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other. Everybody feels this way sometimes.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Wendy. He's the pro. This guy knows relationships. Tell him, Tiffany.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dude.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know I don't have $400,000, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, where did we land on the whole 'plus one' thing?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Still wow.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh yeah, I thought about leaving it at home, but I figured I don't wanna get there and realize I need it and have to go all the way back to get it, so, yeah, I brought it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do it. Do it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's a sixteen?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Claudia.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um (clears throat) She couldn't make it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's so funny? Claudia: Plan a wedding, you'll see.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Claude. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I didn't check 'plus one'. You were right. Franklin: Of course I was right.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Stay out as late as you want.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The whole world full of endless possibilities.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, that explains where Alberto is.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Ranjit!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, you're... you're actually gonna hook up with these girls that call you?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This ought to be good. I can only imagine the quality of girls...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That beer looks a little flat.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Something troubling you, kiddo?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's crazy! And they use \"Ulee\" because of the vowels.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow wow wow, you said you'd go out with him on Valentine's? I thought we had plans!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I did NOT...say... it was a good plan.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK OK OK buddy, how about you do this? Go nail that girl, then read your texts.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So there's a hotter girl. Isn't that the problem in a nutshell? There's too many options. You got internet dating, you got bars...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hm.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Err no he didn't.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  See! That right there is what free will gets you. Constant ego-shattering uncertainty. I'm done with that. I want what Ranjit has. I've spent my entire adult life looking for the perfect woman and I'm spending Valentine's Day scrubbing the toilet. I need someone else to find me that woman. Dan, Pedro, arrange-marriage me!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Absolutely. Looks there's two sides to dating, right? Picking and getting picked. Getting picked, I'm good at. Ladies looove Teddy Westside.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really?! (excited)\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's the picking, I suck at. I pick the wrong girls. But you guys, you're the best pickers I know. You picked each other.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Get out there and find me a girl. We'll double date on Valentine's Day. If I like her, I will marry her... if she's cool with it. And she will be. Cause I'll wear my nice blazer.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what it's like? Wait, I have to get a book. Give me 30 seconds.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK this is fun. Look at this picture. It's a rabbit! You can look at it for hours and be absolutely sure it's a rabbit. But then one day, you look at it and you realize, \"wait a second, it's a duck!\" Rabbit, duck, rabbit, duck. Isn't it fun?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow I think you got it backwards there, buddy. The duck is the thing you love, the rabbit is the thing you hate.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Duck is delicious. Rabbit is all gamey.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (yelling as well) Flavour counts.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hold on, I've got to get another book.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Then why don't we take, a rabbit, a duck, stick 'em in a cardboard box and let them fight it out?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Only if we bet on it, Bertha!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You have to say it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  YESSS.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh I wouldn't be so sure about that, Dianne. Think about it. Don... Donald. Donald... Duck. (Austin sighs heavily) And what, I wonder, does Donald Duck never wear?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Pants. Don's... a duck. (Judd and Nicole sigh in awe of Ted) Permission to say \"lawyered\"?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lawyered.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Here comes the groom in his favorite blazer, gonna meet my wife and I'm...laser, tazer, gaze her, take, bathe her?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's what you're wearing?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's a duck. That dude be straight-ducking. \"And I think that I'll amaze her\". Nailed it!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, Randall, I don't wanna crowd you on your little date here, so if things start to get hot and heavy with Don...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm just saying, if they do... I'll just say \"Well, I got a dinner res\" and then, wait this is the last part, I've been working on it for a while... I'll duck out.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I got a dinner res... (Ted ducks out)\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So he's a rabbit. At least you know for sure.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I've been thinking, hmm, maybe we should call this whole thing off...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's a phone girl!?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Rabbit. Sorry, guys, I gotta go. (he leaves)\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Laurie's phone... I wonder how it got in there?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh what's the harm... Hello!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Terrific. I will see you there. And I'll be the guy in the awesome blazer. Ah ah ah I think you'll know the blazer when you see it. Oooh! I gotta go.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Rabbit. Sorry, guys, I gotta go.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, heeellooooo. (to a pretty girl ; phone rings) Sorry, babe, I gotta take this. Gary's phone, Teddy Westside speaking.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, no, I love it so much. It just keeps ringing and ringing and ringing. Give it, give it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's mine now.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Being single sucks. It turns you into a crazy person.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So long as you can find someone you can sit on the couch and put off cleaning the bathroom with.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Will you marry me?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's Ted!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Actually, I don't know.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Don't know that either.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes. She's exactly the kind of person who would have hobbies. And interests, too. I am one lucky son of a bitch.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? You're crazy! I know plenty.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The color of the ocean after a storm.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Beautiful.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, so I don't know every single detail about Stella. What's really about? Do you not like her or something?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll have a whole life time to get to know her better. Right now, I know the one thing that I have to: that I love her.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? You know... My grandma taught me how.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. I had a lot of time after school to watch her cook because I wasn't good at sports.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, you know, the usual: basil, garlic, olive oil, but can you guess my secret ingredient?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes. How did you know that?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, let me think, what else?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I clearly need to know more about you. Let's do firsts. First kiss?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  First time you had s*x.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Stop it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Prude. Molly McKenzie, junior year of high school.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  First movie you ever saw.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My dad took me to an old drive-in to see the original Star Wars.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You've got to calm down.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dude, it's just a movie.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's just a movie. It's just a movie!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If Stella doesn't like this movie, I can't marry her.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You want to watch it again?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I just thought it'd be fun to watch a movie tonight, and since you've never seen Star Wars, I figured why not? No big deal. It's pretty good.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The movie's already started, so...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God. Corey appears behind the couch.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are you doing down there?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are you doing, hiding behind the couch? You need to get a job.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nothing.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You look really beautiful tonight.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Great scene, great scene. Star Wars fun fact number seven... George Lucas based the film's structure on Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. He also owes a debt to Campbell's work with comparative mythology.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What part, what part?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Great scene.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm gonna take a look. She's not even watching. She's texting.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't believe this. I believe, she knows this is important to me. She's blatantly...(Ted looks at his phone) \"Stop watching me, jackasses.\"\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes! I am marrying a woman who is not only hot but loves Star Wars. That's the dream.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me through the space-time continuum. We did it. We did it, you m*st*rb*t*ng little b*st*rd. Champagne for everybody. Ted leaves the room.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What the...?! LILY: Oh, my God, yeah!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Great!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But we think some kind of sport in which robots wrestlers.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Goes?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I understand how you feel. It is important friendship. In this regard, Emerson wrote a great poem, titled Friendship. You'll love it. \"A drop of crimson blood carries more weight than the waves of the sea...\"\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You must try this Syrah. A taste of creme de cassis, red berries, oak heated... (Pauline and Lucy are the kitchen while Ted sat on the bench) letter in September, baritone white. Of course! A lyric baritone! Which is higher than a bass-baritone.There is a key moment in the second act of La Boheme...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I try to add some class to our meetings. It's like this quote from Dante's Inferno. \"Consider the race of which you are created not to live like brutes but to follow virtue and knowledge.\"Or, in Italian original...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Relax... It's for Marissa Heller.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Fantastic! That must be the previous tenant. I wonder how it looks.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And since, in every mail we receive, the picture becomes clearer. But we know not how it looks. I will follow it as always...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  An invitation to the annual Spring Jefferson Van Smoot, for Saturday night... in his apartment in Alberta! Friends... This is the most beautiful building in Manhattan! We gotta go!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's about an open bar.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This building is fabulous! You saw the gate and terracotta panels outside?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's Marissa Heller. She is pretty.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm on it. This lift uses the same mechanism from its installation in 1906. It seems that Lamar Louis Skolnick, the architect of the building, has cut the panels himself.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And some French influence inside! He was an architect with a poet's soul, really.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I must make a confession. It is not on the list, but I always wanted to see the inside of Alberta.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Prem's.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is Peter Bogdanovich, talking to Arianna Huffington and Will Shortz, crossword editors of The New York Times! Try at least, Chow and alcohol free. 20 minutes and off we go.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry, you talk about the fourth book of madrigals?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is my favorite book of madrigals.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know who published an article on great Walt Whitman, and political semantics? Professor Hammersmith Oxford.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Friends, Will Shortz, editors of the Times crossword. You know, I always say they use \"Ulee\" of Gold Life for vowels? Tell them.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ten letters, a diminutive egg pie?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There. A great reception.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I missed that glitch. I know, do not bother to say. There's no glitch in the wine.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, I'm having fun here, so I'll pass Robots vs. Wrestlers.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Actually, I like those pretentious snobs and they are not old fashioned fart noise when I open my mouth. I remain. See you tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  See you tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, a reading of poetry.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Citrus and honeycomb with a sharp acidity. This is a Sauvignon Blanc, Loire Valley. The town of Sancerre.\n"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of course, hell is an interesting concept, is not it? I always liked to imagine it as Dante's Divine Comedy. If I may. Italian original... (Thinking...) I do not believe it. I recite the Divine Comedy in Italian original, and nobody makes fart noises. It's weird. I've never gone that far. I just seem to be an asshole. My God, I control myself! Listen to me, I am completely let go! I'm the biggest asshole on the planet. I wish someone stops me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I gotta run.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? Because there is a poem I would recite... Friendship of Ralph Waldo Emerson. \"A drop of crimson blood carries more weight than the waves of the sea The world uncertain comes and goes...\"\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Your costumes came.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's right.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You mean, who is the Slutty Pumpkin? It was four years ago.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I was at this Halloween party up on the roof of our building. I'm about to call it an early night when out of nowhere appeared this girl in the sexiest pumpkin costume.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was carved in strategic places.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, uh, we're at the bar and I see her mix kahlua...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And she...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, can I please tell this story? So we had this instant connection. She gave me her number, but then something...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Guys! Something went terribly wrong.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sonny, where's Cher?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I just met the perfect woman. She's funny. She's beautiful. She loves Star Wars.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Loves them.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Get this, she's a marine biologist. She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, where's my, uh, Kit Kat? I put it right here on this table.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No no no, you don't understand. I need that Kit Kat. She wrote her number on that wrapper. Where is it?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Dracula. Come on. Give me your candy. Gimme!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where's the Kit Kat? Where's the Kit Kat!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Never found her number, never saw her again. But every year they have a Halloween party up on the roof so that's where I'll be.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know, I got a feeling. This could be the year. Halloween is a night of wonder and magic.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, bring the mockery. Fine, I can take it. Come on, wouldn't it be the coolest story ever if the Slutty Pumpkin turned out to be my future wife?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Can't wait.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow! Julie, you wearing eye liner?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And how much did you pay for your costumes?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I think you guys look great.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, I want the Slutty Pumpkin to recognize me and she knows me as a hanging chad.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? She thought it was hilarious.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where are you going?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No thanks. I'm sticking with the hanging chad.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year. Tonight, I'm going up to the roof, I'm gonna have a few beers, I'm gonna wait for the Slutty Pumpkin. That's just what I do.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm heading up to the roof.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, word play. Funny.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I didn't. You followed me up here.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Relax, the night is young. It's gonna get better.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Vernon, come on, I'm having fun. It's really great seeing these guys again.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, there's ninja, back of horse. Where's front of horse? That guys a riot. Where is he?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? That's the nickname now?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The Barnacle.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Have fun, Barnacle.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Theresa. What, you're back?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  In a totally new costume.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's half you're pathetic, half I have to pee.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the Slutty Pumpkin.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nope.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She might.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, Beverly, this is not about the odds, this is about believing. This girl, she represents something to me, I don't know, hope.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (shrugs) See ya.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, excuse me, this is gonna sound crazy, but I met someone up on this roof four years ago and they mixed that cocktail and they loved penguins. By any chance, was that you? It's you. I was crazy but I can't...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Unbelievable.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nice.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm staying.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey. If you're here for the Shagarats, you just missed the fourth encore.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are we playing 'I never' cuz there's nothing left but peach schnapps.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Man, that sucks.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. Look, you didn't want to be with me so clearly you have abysmal taste in men.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But you're wired just fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Because you just haven't met the right Hansel yet. One day you're gonna meet a guy who's gonna make you want to look like a complete idiot.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, he's out there somewhere, just like the Slutty Pumpkin. (echoes) pumpkin-pumpkin...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I'm pretty drunk. Look, I know that odds are the love of my life isn't going to magically walk through that door in a pumpkin costume at 2:43 in the morning but it seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know, sit and wait.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So you don't want coffee.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right. I'm pouring it out.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us. \"The kid\" has become \"the man.\"\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I love you too, Marshmallow.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, no. No, she didn't.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Another care package?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Three.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  In the mail or in my mind? Zero. She's up three-zip. Oh! Cupcakes! Great. I bet they're delicious, too. Yup, they're delicious. Damn it! I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes. God, I hate myself right now.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sure you don't want one?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Four. Teen. No, just four. And the icing from two more. So, anyway, here's the problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep. Anyway, I got the care package, and it's just great. Here, listen... Mmm. Mmm!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake... And... I said something dumb.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail. I sent it a couple days ago. And it's awesome. Really, really awesome.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why did I say that? I think frosting makes me lie.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her. So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's brilliant. You're brilliant. You know, it's funny, not so long ago, I was coming to Joanne and Brittany for advice on how to impress you.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yep. Yesterday.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ooh, she loved it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you, we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half. Eventually you just run out of stuff to say.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What did you have for lunch today? Oh. Rye bread. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch. Maybe it just can't be do. I think it's clear what I have to do.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have to go to Germany and surprise her.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh-oh.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So she's going to dump me. Has anyone ever said, \"Listen, I've been thinking,\" and then follow it up with something good? It's not like: Listen, I've been thinking, Nutter-Butters are an underrated cookie. What else can it be? What could she possibly have to say to me that she couldn't write in an e-mail?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy. So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks. Anyway, it's almost 11:00. I should let you go. Break a leg.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mike.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you in a month.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think Victoria's about to break up with me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like. The more I try to picture her, the more I can't. Like, I remember how she makes me feel. I just... I don't completely remember her. It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, I can find. With Mothers Who I'd like Sunset And Never Forgot.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A great book.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's going to happen.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You'll fall in love.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We play Pyramid. What people are saying just before meeting the love.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Travis Frenchroy, replacing bartender told me... \"I'm done with all these rencards. I want to concentrate on my fan fiction of Star Trek. \"Six months later... Married!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It happens, whatever you say. It is a law of nature.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Trust me. I would not get interested in relationships. I would not be single if I wanted to be single.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ready for what?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why do not you talk to me now?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah she was pretty.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I promise to do anything stupid.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm thinking. Do I want to date a girl that Christine was typed?Help me for harmonies. Of course.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Or rather, look for a husband.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Taking the newspaper, think to watch the ads for marriages.For yours.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my god, it's horrible. I wonder if it works.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He starts singing and objects come alive and dance with him.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Apparently, it will rain.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I will prepare my toast.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, go out with him.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's The Diver.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, because it is... this kind.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  'Kay. Oh, go on, touch it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, so, Peyton, are you doing this or what?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, Serenity, it's the greatest pickup line of all time. Joanne.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whoo-hoo!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait for it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nope. I hit the snooze button.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's not like I have a list.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Any Kim from any cool band, really. Can't be too picky.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me. I am done trying to plan the unplannable.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's the plan.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whoa, you're up early.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Does Micheal know?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Please don't do that. Hey, is this milk any good?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  God, why didn't you throw it away?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Speaking.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So I'm in good hands. You found me a match?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, fine. Set it up.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Priscilla?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um... yes.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? What? No. Can't you just call Leo?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can't, I'm waiting...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, Marjorie.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, stay there. I'm on my way.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I won't.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I swear on Luke and Leia.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did you talk to Jo about it?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That was you? Awesome!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You don't want to get married.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Veronica, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Valerie. I think it's pretty clear what that means.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't think you're stupid.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All done.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Leon, don't do this to yourself.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know. You said \"mistake\" a lot. Ted, don't do this.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Forgive you for what? (Barry leaves with he car) Barry. Barry! Hey, Barry, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road. I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk... Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you. And, also, I texted you the same thing. (He calls Kelly) Hey, I need a big favor.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's kind of an emergency.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Apple picking. Can you just get up here?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh... Clarence. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank. I'm not in Duchess County.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Candy?!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nope. Sworn to secrecy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I like your hat.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh. I gotta see this.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She loves lasagna.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, I am sensing a pattern here.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? You don't want kids?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, thanks for picking me up.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're going to show me your hair?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You just made my night.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, guys.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You think you might want to... drink the milk?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I didn't go.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't want perfect. I want Vincent.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, is this milk any good?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know how to make crepes? That is so cool.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I got your total...counting along...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're scared of the Seven Dwarfs?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? Why not?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, it'll be fun.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Guys, guys, guys, Leona doesn't like malls. If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to. I think we should all just respect her privacy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, what's the deal with you and malls?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, with those people. I'm your boyfriend. Come on, what is it? Did you get arrested in a mall?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dumped in a mall?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Found out you were Canadian at a mall?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Chad: Let it go.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mauled at the mall?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What, I don't get it, why won't Cindy tell me why she hates malls?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I disagree. If there's some potential 'oh' moment, I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I love you.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's true. They tell each other everything.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Trust me, not only do they tell each other everything. They want to know everything.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's not what I'm hey-ing you about.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Married? What does have to do with the mall?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She's not married. Melinda hates marriage.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I don't know, whenever I ask her about Canada, she kinda clams up.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you Elaine.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I need another beer.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, what if I ask Noelle point-blank if she has a husband?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, you're right.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Husband.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Fine, I'll take it back.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Jeff, you know Jeff. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Just say, \"no, I'm not married.\"\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You have a husband? Alexa: I was young and stupid and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall and I haven't been to a mall since.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why didn't you get divorced?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How can I keep something like that to myself? And you begged me to tell you.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Fine, Jamie's married.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's serious to me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Fine, I won't tell Mario. What is it?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? Then, why would she tell me she was?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There must be some mistake.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, she lied to me? What, what am I gonna do? I can't confront her 'cause then she'll know I told you.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  In order for me to get total closure on this whole my-girlfriend-has-a-husband thing, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more information. Like, what month did you get married? Marion: June. We had a June wedding.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ah, Canada in June. That's great.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sit down or buffet.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hm. Band of DJ?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How many bridesmaids? Jeanne: Seven.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Flowers? Aubrey: Azaleas.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Color scheme?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Husband's name?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You were never married.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No you weren't.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I looked it up at the library.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The one on 5th.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad....\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You lied to me!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But it was a fake secret.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Testing me, that's insane.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That wasn't a real secret.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are you talking about?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. No I don't.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Katrina wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, Arthur, I said we're not watching this.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh my God.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I slap bet Joann that you did p0rn, so I win.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh my God, Noah's rapping. Guys, Noah's rapping.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Go with the 10 now.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Horrible call.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, she doesn't wanna wait.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow! What's this?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A fedora! (he puts it on his head and pulls out a whip) I'm Indiana Jones! I'm Indiana Jones!!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what we should do? We should...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  God... you just get me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right. (imitating Clint Eastwood) Hey, dummy (to a mannequin). What did tell you about smoking in here?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm so sorry.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can whip me if you want.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know what you're all thinking. Who's this cool peer of mine up in front the class?\" I know the board says \"Professor Mosby,\" but to you I'm Ted.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Question. Awesome. Hit it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They're at home. I...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, God.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Christian, it was awful. I was teaching...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I am freaking out. I don't think I can do this.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't think the talk is necessary.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Because Jill is already his girlfriend.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Gremlins\"?\n"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, new topic. How do I pick a tie?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (for himself) Wait. Does professor have one \"F\" or two? Oh, my God... Oh, my God! Professor. Pro-fess-or. They're all staring at me. I don't know. Just do something! Two \"F's\". That looks right. I think that's right.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good morning. 'Sup, dudes? Silence! This is Architecture 101. I am Professor Mosby. But you can call me Ted. Professor Mosby. T-Dawg. Do not call me T-Dawg.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Please save all your questions until the end of the lecture. Thank you! Now...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Here's your think-about-it for the day. Every single person in this room... is already an architect.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Can anyone here tell me what this class is really all about?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Don't laugh. He's not... He's not entirely wrong. An architect must be economical in his use of space, so... well done. Looks like someone's building towards an A.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (to a student) You... Why do you want to be an architect?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, exactly. It's not something you want to be. It's something you need to be. You don't have a choice, right? None of you has a choice.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No questions!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So if any of you have even the slightest inclination to do anything with your life other than become an architect, you're wasting my time and yours. There's the door... You can go. I'm serious. Get out, now.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait... Don't... all leave! Architecture's fun! Look! I brought a hacky sack!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry, sir. This is... Architecture 101. Who invited their dad, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Euh, yeah, but, I'm sure 200 architecture students and their professor all got the room wrong.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Kids, out of my way! Sorry. Coming through. Excuse me. Coming through.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, but here's the funny thing. By that point, I didn't have time to think about what kind of teacher I was going to be. I just got up there and talked about architecture. And it was kind of great.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (to Raymond) Yeah, I got you, buddy. (to Sally and Marion) They still haven't had the talk?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You do realize they were lying, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, beeing married, different? Not different?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Colleen brownies.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Rosemary Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Seen 'em.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm just happy Stephanie's happy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm just happy Fernando's happy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm just jubilant my former paramour's jubilant.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. That guy. Look at how easy he has it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's better looking than us.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mmm.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. Plus automatic out, you're leaving in a couple of days. God, I wish we were tourists.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, okay. We're from a small town in the south of France. Our plane leaves sunday morning.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, hey, you-you ladies, been awful nice to us. What do you say... ah, never mind. No...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, it's just we're leaving sunday morning. It sure would be nice to have some real New Yorkers show us around.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? It doesn't seem that lame to me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think it's cool.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (yelling)I'm just saying it seems like a kind of bar a lot of cool people would hang out there.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, I'm sure this is the best of their 57 \"spudtacular\" east coast locations.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Easiest? Somehow we have managed to find the two lamest new yorkers of all time.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm looking at you. What?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, Ignatius, one more hour.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey. If we're going north, why did we cross over the FDR? We should have taken the Hudson.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where are we even going anyway?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A hundred... on the south of Bronx at this time of night? We're going to get killed.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There were three of them, at least two guns... they took all our money.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Thank God, we're alive\" s*x.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right. I'm in. I've never worked this hard for anything in my life.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whew.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? West village?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  West Orange? New Jersey?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You guys live in New Jersey, not New York?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  New Jersey?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, no. Oh, no.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  New Jersey is not \"pretty much New York\". You are not \"pretty much new yorkers\".\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to \"pretty much New York\"? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Actually, yes. You know, he never gives flowers to a girl, because living things remind babies?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The other day I saw him in a flower shop on the 82nd, he bought roses.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. It is even more in Manhattan. Where does this girl?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He stops.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, Grant looks pretty good.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I just remembered where I know you. I saw you play at the theater of disorientation, Die heilige Johanna der Schlachth&ouml;fe by Bertolt Brecht, last fall. You were a revelation!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes. Sorry. You got a Brechtophile before thee!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mrs Theatre has won my heart once and has never left me. Every year at Christmas, I created a piece for parents with all the kids.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Cut! Cut! Grandpa and Grandma will be there in half an hour, and you always skinned my words. I feel like I'm going to write, direct and play this thing. Give me your elf hat. Sit down.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I always wanted to be an actor. It is this kind of dream that flies away with time.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Is it I who betrayed, or that you have betrayed me?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  November 14, 1998. The night train to Monte Carlo. I was in the car pool arnaquant Algerians few thousand dinars, while thou séduisais my bride! Who is blind and took you for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know not well what I mean?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of course I do! And for sure I'll hear you admit it, manure!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Honestly, I played a really Ted, I tried not to be him.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mom...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Who do you like in Die Hard?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll watch the film again with you.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And those girls over there? They are cannon.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Anything.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're gonna be a father? How will it happen?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I had lunch early, so I can eat.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We can not decide for you. It's huge.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He thinks what?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Terrence is a very good father.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You panic and you see only bad side.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, I know you're afraid of not being ready. But we think ever be. You just take the plunge and it will come naturally.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A cereal killer! A cereal killer!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm not sorry. I'm just disappointed.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello, Lori, me, this is Ted. I will be your customer tonight.Before leaving, tell me. What is a killer in a wheat field? No index.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do not appreciate that tone, young lady.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll tell you why my opponent says it all. Three words: fear of... babies.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And when we saw my cousin and her baby? She's so cute!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where the party that Max had done for her friend Erika?You do feel for this baby?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And do not forget...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Pub with baby talk.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But you're not like that. You like children too.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think you're taking a \"chausettogari\", eh, Marcus?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You, shut up, baby-phobic.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where is Jackie? You have to drink?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do not either.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I dream, it has been lost.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's good that we have broken. I had totally forgotten your psychosis on the kids.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  God thank you, you're not my mother. You're an ice queen. All you have breastfed baby by a frozen brain.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're in good company there.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay. When you have finished, you could ask a magician to heart.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No argument.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Super.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Your cell phone rang. I answered. Hope it bother you. Alfredo is at Steve. She is fine.\n"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  You've stolen the Ca sock Jeremy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Falling in? \"\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dan Scherbatsky, you get the idea of having children?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There were two difficult months both. I have a room free.Why not come to me in the meantime?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Day of Non-Fathers, it sucks. It's a feast for the losers.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is the effect cheerleaders.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good night, Sandra.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Plugging in.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No way. You're making this up.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come live with us.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of course.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? What are you talking about?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, so?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, we've talked about it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, that's a tough one. You know who I think could handle a problem like that?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Future Ted and Future Hailey.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dammit Past Ted\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's crazy. They're not edging me out. Dawn's my best friend.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, see, he's gonna go back over there and I'm gonna call him and he's gonna pretend that it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's gonna want the apartment. I'm gonna want the apartment. It's gonna lead to an argument, so no.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I should really make this call.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ah, this'll be nice, the three of us living together. I think it's a good setup.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Man, this coffee's great. It's really great. Too great.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What happened to Shocky?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's this? Tristan: My coffeemaker from my apartment. Makes great coffee, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, definitely. I mean, so does Shocky.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, no, it did. I mean, I kinda liked the rusty taste. I'm used to it. I don't know.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. You gotta admit, that shock, wakes you up in the morning\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's great. You're right. Roomies! I love it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's not just the coffeemaker.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, that would be a good place for it. Too bad the swords are there. We kinda love those swords.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know, right? I'd really miss them too. So, maybe Jennie's room?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He was gonna take the swords down. Can you believe that?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What, like buy a new sofa?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, awesome. It's great, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I like it, so I'm just gonna keep it right here, if that's cool.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, so it's like that, is it?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I want this apartment.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right Neil, we're deciding right now who gets this apartment. It may lead to an argument, but we're settling this.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, let's flip a coin.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, I'm flipping it, here I go.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, here I go.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm flipping. But before I do, I just wanna say something. You didn't even wanna move in here in the first place. You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, I'm flipping. Heads or tails.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Heads or tails, Michael. Like you need two rooms?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, no you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're in law school. It's gonna be at least three years.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, come on, you know damn well I move out that room's going unused.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, well, at least Rosemary wouldn't take the swords down.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We were bros! These swords represent our bro-hood. And you took 'em down to make room for your fiance's stupid painting?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I deserve this apartment, Mario.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Great, so let's flip for it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, is this how we're deciding who gets the apartment?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How are we doing this exactly? Is this like to the death?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's OK, it's OK.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Can I observe something?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Totally.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, but this time, jump up and I'll swipe your legs.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look. Here's why I should get the place. You and Lynn, you get to be married. What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates. And on top of that I could be homeless. Does that seem fair?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Anhedonic?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's OK, it led to this totally rad sword fight, didn't it?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was the day we moved in.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Congratulations, Earl. We live in an apartment with swords on the wall.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Just use this wood glue, it'll hold.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, Jason, do you really think she's still your fiancé? I'm kidding. Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment. Jason: But you fought so bravely for it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I wasn't fighting for the apartment. I was fighting for...I don't know...for everything to stay the way it is. But I'm not gonna get that, so, seriously, take the place, it's yours.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Just let him have this one.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, you didn't win. I gave it to you.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, that's Future Guy's problem. Let that guy deal with it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Chinese restaurant, I still don't believe it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There are jerk faces and there are buttholes.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wedding's over.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I guess starting tomorrow, we can tell people.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The food looks delicious, doesn't it?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Can we talk about this later?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Stephen?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whoo, that was a close one.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But we don't want to draw attention away from Sara and Hailey's big day.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's pretty big, though.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, we'll get you back to your table. Come on.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How about a slide show of you guys through the years set to Green Day's \"Time of Your Life\" and ending with your baby photos side by side.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, isn't doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a clichée?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Perry?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. Thanks. Cheers.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, \"Champagne?\" \"We didn't order any champagne.\" \"Compliments of the house.\" \"Wow.\"\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's what she said.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's not mine.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What the hell was that?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That reaction?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Now more than ever.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, \"No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. \"Ted, you cannot do this to me. \"No. No, no, no.\"\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Was there a side of champagne with each of the strawberries?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, seriously. Where do you see yourself in five years?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Honestly, in five years... I probably want to be married.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Argentina?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We have an expiration date, don't we?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Francisco... story's not over.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, of course. Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this. Can we actually...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wha... what?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Run!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license till we bring the horn back.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, I'm sorry about the French horn. I want to make this right. So what we're going to do right now is, we're going to run!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So... Argentina.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I could want to live in Argentina.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too. They have buildings in Argentina. And Paris. And even Tokyo. I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're scared I might not be kidding.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nope. Your move, Scherbatsky.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Travis. The story's not over yet.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do what?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, right. 'Cause there are no kids there. On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black \"X\" over Argentina.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Risk it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, have fun in Scotland. If you see the Loch Ness Monster, tell him Ted Mosby says, \"What's up?\"\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, kiddo.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The story's not over, Brandon.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, time to get the horn back to the bistro.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not a euphemism.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whoa, whoa, you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh. Solidarity, sister.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, if we'd actually moved in together, all my stuff would be here, but we didn't, so...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We're not doing this, are we?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And I don't want to have kids in Argentina.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well... we could stay together and... pretend this stuff doesn't matter. Or... we could give back the blue French horn.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yep.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, afterwards, uh, we came by to tell you guys, but Kaylee was pretty stressed out, so...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, it hasn't been the easiest two weeks of our lives, but...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The open bar helps.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, we knew this day would come eventually. Take care of her, little man.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Could be.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, Carole.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is the toughest time in Jeffery's life and I feel absolutely useless. What can we do to help?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Cigarettes, alcohol... Are these firecrackers? My God, Gloria, you somehow crammed Tijuana into a purse.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Judy duty.\"\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, okay, while not all of us possess your lofty sense of decorum, Drug-DealerFrom-An-'80s-After-School-Special, we have to laugh today. It's healthy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What about animals?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're like Mary Poppins, if her magic purse was also filled with drugs.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah! This video is entitled, \"Little League Coach Gets Hit in the Nuts by a Foul Ball and Then Vomits in a Garbage Can.\" I don't wanna give anything away. Let's just watch.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ...right in the nuts,\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That guy gave you noogies? What, did he carry a stepladder?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let's see what happens.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And then the fat kid loses his swim trunks.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She's right. I mean, this idea that someone's last words have to be profound and meaningful? I mean, who can live up to that?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, think of it this way: you get to hear your dad's voice one last time.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whoa. Are you okay?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, but this day is tough on you, too. You sure you can absorb all that?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know mine. When I was in Cleveland last month, I went to visit my dad at his... post-divorce bachelor pad.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah... so glad we can we can talk about our s*x lives now. That's totally an improvement.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My prom date?!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have to go.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, they might be. Donna Bromstead's husband is a cop.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's awful.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Sebastian laugh once.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Stupid.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes. Nothing beats the immediacy of live theater. But which one of us is going to take the hit?(Jackie hits Ted in the nuts) So that's it? No discussion?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Is he laughing?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  These stories suck.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, seriously, how are you doing that?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi, Dad.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I love your idea about a giant rooftop ring of fire you can jump through with a motorcycle, but I tweaked it slightly and... This is still super bad-ass. It's now a patio garden where you can bring a nice bag lunch.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, no, thank you. Still got it.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Terrence, we have to talk.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Dary.\"\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can't design the building.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did you just say \"snakes\"?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  New is always better?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And when you're at a Guns n' Roses concert, you're like, \"Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy\"?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wendy! I'd like to buy my friend a drink. What's your oldest Scotch?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Amazing. And what's your newest scotch?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Your call, buddy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Told him what?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? I... There's no g-girl. Why would you even... Her name is Zoey.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, mister, you are very convincing, and I am very flattered. Confused, even. But I'm not looking...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not only is she funny, hot and genetically female, but get this...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We wound up talking for hours.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Old is always better. I can't wait to be old.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can shoplift and pretend you're just confused.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I'd say you got a pretty long wait.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where do I sign?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well... Uh, it's a... it's a funny thing about that...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm a veterinarian.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? I panicked!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't do that.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, off to meet Steph. We're adrenaline junkies! [...]Penelope is taking me to the Battle of Gettysburg. We're gonna eat squirrel! [...] (Ted enters the living room, dressed up as a wizard) Look, she's really hot, okay?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Darryl pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And Priscilla never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Chris.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did you just say \"eggs\"?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Zoey... I'm Batman. Hmm. That'd be cool.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wasn't expecting bunnies.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Absolutely. Just let me run up and get my bag of vet supplies. Okay. Why would I say that?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You just broke in and stole these guys? Aren't you worried about getting arrested?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. You're a little bit crazy.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. Yeah. Although I hear there's a lovely rooftop patio where folks can enjoy a nice bag lunch, so...\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Solid C-cup, perky bounce.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I can't tear down The Arcadian. I'm sorry, but I'm off the project.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, you really got to me the other night. I want to get involved with \"Save The Arcadian.\"\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She was really hot, okay?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How the hell could you do that?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The billboard, Diana.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?!\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You named the rabbit?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, that explains a few voicemails. Listen, Zoey, I think we can save The Arcadian. No. Maybe not in the way you were picturing, but I stayed up all night working on a new concept, all right? What if my design could incorporate The Arcadian's facade into the new GNB headquarters?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are you married?\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, it was about the girl.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This wouldn't work. Zoey, The Arcadian was a really great building once, but it's falling apart, and it's full of snakes.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't recall saying snakes.\n"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, what's not for everyone?\n"}
