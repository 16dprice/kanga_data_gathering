," Ted: That's funny. She barely touched me. Uh, Gate 23. Come on. If we miss this flight, I will never forgive myself.
"
," Ted: Hi, wait, two more.
"
," Ted: Well, I'm sure if we pull real hard we can open them.
"
," Ted: Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss the chance to interview for my dream job.
"
," Ted: Please, I have to be on this flight.
"
," Ted: Thanks.
"
," Ted: Great, please let us know as soon as you hear anything.
"
," Ted: Normally, I'm incredibly responsible. I just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced. Not that I'm a criminal or anything.
"
," Ted: That thing better have call waiting.
"
," Ted: It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today. I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage. I'm so stupid. Why did I have to jump that turnstile?
"
," Ted: Wow, your first broken bone. Kind of kills your whole ""Unbreakable"" theory.
"
," Ted: There was a really heavy door. He opened it.
"
," Ted: Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Dianne, it's like 26 miles.
"
," Ted: Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet. Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang ""Hungry Like the Wolf,"" and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to?
"
," Ted: Wow. Very impressive, Evelyn.
"
," Ted: You're dating a girl from New Jersey?
"
," Ted: Hello?
"
," Ted: What, what are you talking about?
"
," Ted: (to Dora) Sophie's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train.
"
," Ted: All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.
"
," Ted: Tara?!
"
," Ted: You're right. Everything can be traced back to him. Like that rash we all got at Christmas. I have to see what's going on.
"
," Ted: Really? That's great!
"
," Ted: Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on?
"
," Ted: What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today.
"
," Ted: I think it was something like Flights R' Us.
"
," Ted: God, I hope not.
"
," Ted: Stupid smart carts. More like dumb carts.
"
," Ted: You know, Guy never would have run the marathon in the first place if Sherry hadn't broken his toe.
"
," Ted: So, yes, it was your fault. I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Vickie doesn't break his toe, Isaac doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time! (Ted fells) And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport.
"
," Ted: Oh, looks like they're camping out for something.
"
," Ted: I don't know. Usually there's a Stormtrooper or Klingon in line to give you some indication. ""Annual wedding dress blowout. Designer sample dresses up to 90% off. Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m.""
"
," Ted: Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it. Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight.
"
," Ted: Would you check to see if you have any more seats?
"
," Ted: Armando...
"
," Ted: Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny?
"
," Ted: No. Wait. It goes back further. Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side?
"
," Ted: 1939?! This penny's from 1939! (at the bar with Natalie) A 67-year-old penny. Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II?
"
," Ted: Look, I know a little something about coins, and this baby is worth something to a collector.
"
," Ted: Yes, it is! You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner with the money I get for this little guy.
"
," Ted: Hey, that's 150 times its original value. Actually, the meal was only $1.49. 1984.
"
," Ted: How dare you.
"
," Ted: I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something.
"
," Ted: It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town.
"
," Ted: Nelson wouldn't have broken his toe. Gavin wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date...
"
," Ted: I wish I did. Though that person's already been punished enough, losing a sweet penny like that.
"
," Ted: Oh, please tell me you have some good news.
"
," Ted: I can't believe this. That's it, it's over.
"
," Ted: Of course you feel that way, Johnny. You and Dianne have basically melded into one big hermaphroditic blob. And that's fine for you guys. But some of us want a partner who challenges us to grow and evolve.
"
," Ted: Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Growing matches.
"
," Ted: The main character is a young spoiled prince thrust into leadership after the death of his father. It's obviously a modern-day retelling of Henry IV!
"
," Ted: Okay, clearly, when we're watching Tommy Boy, we're watching two different movies.
"
," Ted: No, you hang up.
"
," Ted: No, you hang up.
"
," Ted: No, you hang up! (Later) No, you hang up.
"
," Ted: No, you... (His phone starts beeping) Hold on. (beep) Hello?
"
," Ted: Why would you do that?!
"
," Ted: Who likes that?
"
," Ted: Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy.
"
," Ted: It's dinero.
"
," Ted: You know, sometimes I feel bad for Vincent and Tanya.
"
," Ted: It's like they never challenge each other. They just automatically agree all the time.
"
," Ted:Yes, they do.
"
," Ted:Yes, they do. It's like they...
"
," Ted: Hey, Christine, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play ""Who's Hot and Who's Scott?""
"
," Ted: Oh, come on. Everything's not ruined.
"
," Ted: What? Why?
"
," Ted: I'm furiously enjoying being challenged.
"
," Ted: Why don't you admit that Eddie quitting his job and taking an unpaid internship is killing you?
"
," Ted: Arnold, the downside to having giant, Japanese anime eyes is that they're easy to read. And yours are screaming, ""What about my trip to Spain, deadbeat?""
"
," Ted: We take turns! Sometimes.
"
," Ted: Ah, Anna Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple! I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks. One: your mom didn't seem to mind it last night on her...
"
," Ted: You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Sandra doesn't make us a worse couple.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God, is that how support feels? It's so warm and wonderful. Oh, Willie, I've been so unhappy.
"
," Ted: Nobody likes being challenged! Couldn't she agree with me just once, even on something little, like... like what movie to see or-or what topping to get on our pizza or... oh, I don't know, my lifelong dream of building a skyscraper in New York City?!
"
," Ted: You were right, Vivan. I mean, Zoey's great, but... sometimes I do wish we were a little more like you and Joseph. There he is. Here we go. (Ted says some incomprehensible things in spanish)
"
," Ted: Um, he speaks perfect English.
"
," Ted: Then why did you ask me to come?
"
," Ted: W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain?
"
," Ted: What are you gonna tell Dustin, huh? And when are you coming back?
"
," Ted: Wow, tha... that's an evocative metaphor to use for your nonthreatening, totally patriotic emotions. U.S.A.! Okay, Kelly, I get it.
"
," Ted: But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough.
"
," Ted: Lil...
"
," Ted: Yeah, absolutely. Um, listen, something happened at the airport. Um...
"
," Ted: Well, we got there, and, uh, Lewis...(sighs) Lewis...
"
," Ted: Hey! What are you doing here?
"
," Ted: This you can be supportive of?!
"
," Ted: I have the chance to build a skyscraper in the best city on Earth, and who's the one leading the charge to kill that dream? My girlfriend!
"
," Ted: Uh, Alex, you got a little marinara on your pajamas.
"
," Ted: Stella! Glad to see you again!
"
," Ted: And Tony! What a nice surprise.
"
," Ted: We had a friendly discussion and we resumed our respective paths.
"
," Ted: I am not on the back. Or stomach. I want to move forward.And it was an important step towards that. The future.
"
," Ted: I know. I'm better than you.
"
," Ted: Sold!
"
," Ted: No, between. It's not weird at all.
"
," Ted: Sad? No. I think what you call sorrow was only... jovial nonchalance.
"
," Ted: Why are you here?
"
," Ted: I met lots of girls.
"
," Ted: I switched to running a small business. This is the lung of the economy.
"
," Ted: Yeah! He has not signed a check.
"
," Ted: A job?
"
," Ted: No thank you.
"
," Ted: I will not be a professor. That's what you do when your career is in trouble and you have to pay the bills. Manager of small business. The lung of the economy. I will not take this job, okay? I'll get through. New topic.
"
," Ted: I understand. ""Ack-Ted. ""I understood.
"
," Ted: What now?
"
," Ted: Tony, I do not need your help.
"
," Ted: Now that's a very big check.
"
," Ted: I want to design a home that showcases the landscape without dominating. IN 1935, when Frank Lloyd Wright designed the house to the waterfall...
"
," Ted: The laundry room?
"
," Ted: Gruesome.
"
," Ted: A deadly house.
"
," Ted: The steak is very rare.
"
," Ted: Do not you?
"
," Ted: It's a bit serious, huh?
"
," Ted: I will not do.
"
," Ted: I will not do it!
"
," Ted: Stop! I do not want your help, OK? You did not do that.
"
," Ted: Why?
"
," Ted: Let me reassure you. I do not want to Stella. She lied to me, dumped me at the altar. Who can do that? I'm better off without her. It is all yours, buddy.
"
," Ted: Stella?
"
," Ted: Tony left you?
"
," Ted: Let's talk in the hallway.
"
," Ted: Why are you here?
"
," Ted: No, it's not what happens. Tuck, Mrs. Matsen. Delighted to have you review, Stella.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Yes, it's cruel to ask it.
"
," Ted: You love her? What, you do call my romance? It's your strategy? Because this guy is gone. You can have me over like that. I am attached to nothing, thanks to you.
"
," Ted: Enter!
"
," Ted: Enter!
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: Slow down. What's going on?
"
," Ted: I'm a little busy.
"
," Ted: You wanna do something for me? I have to go in New Jersey.
"
," Ted: You talk about Claudette? She is fine.
"
," Ted: I talk to Tony.
"
," Ted: I want you to be happy. I will speak to him.
"
," Ted: Just tell me one thing. Why Tony? I mean, it's money, pajamas kung fu? Finally... What is it?
"
," Ted: Good.
"
," Ted: I will say out loud something that I had managed not to say out loud. Have you, Tony and you... That at one point I thought I had with you... I know that Craig and Terrence... I want that. I want to. I keep waiting and waiting for that to happen and... I guess I'm just... tired of waiting. And that's all I have to say about it.
"
," Ted: Really?
"
," Ted: Really?
"
," Ted: Really?
"
," Ted: You're talking about her boobs, right?
"
," Ted: So these boobs...
"
," Ted: Paint me a word picture.
"
," Ted: Why could you come in? you hear me shaving!
"
," Ted: Well, clearly i wasn't!
"
," Ted: I've never been to this neighborhood. Kind of thought this part of town was water
"
," Ted: Dowisetrepla?
"
," Ted: Is that an abbreviation for something?
"
," Ted: oh!
"
," Ted: Are you serious? You're trying to sneak this apartment away from Herminia and Josephine?
"
," Ted: There was a fight here.
"
," Ted: Whenever Ritthy and Genesis have a big argument, they always leave a trail of evidence all over the apartment.
"
," Ted: HUm the Mosby boys cracked a lot of big cases.
"
," Ted: We solved the mystery of the missing retainer.
"
," Ted: Why are you like this? Anyway, this is serious. I know Ryan and Leona. All the tell tale signs are here. Like this
"
," Ted: It's not stiny water bottle. Notice the label is peed off.
"
," Ted: Just as i suspected, Cherry Garcia. Given the liquid consistency, i place the fight between... noon and 1.
"
," Ted: Taylor stood here. Eating and yelling, yelling and eating. Luis stood here. Crying. (Ted takes a handkerchief on the bar of the kitchen)
"
," Ted: And then Curtis tried to storm out... but Wilma went for the Hail Marpass.
"
," Ted: There'd be a bigger mess. tempted as he was, Marvin was still too upset.
"
," Ted: Nice catch, Gerald.
"
," Ted: Now that we need is a motive. The million dollar question what were they fighting about?
"
," Ted: bup bup bup bup bup... Theres's only one possible conclusion. Julian and Ryan are fighting about peanut butter.
"
," Ted: Brandie left the lid off... (Ted put dark sunglasses) and marshall blew heads.
"
," Ted: I appreciate your help, but there's a reason your name is Zoe, not Batman.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Nice try Cecil. So, the next thing Vincent did was give Roberta a few hours to cool off about the peanut butter. Then she called him to apologize, which is why the last number dialed is... (Ted take the phone and see the last number)
"
," Ted: This can't be happening.
"
," Ted: Not Eileen and Anthony, no way.
"
," Ted: What do you mean?
"
," Ted: Even if they break up, that doesn't mean we can't all hangout. I mean we broke up and we still hang out. It's not weird.
"
," Ted: Yeah, it is. It's weird.
"
," Ted: I hit redial on the phone. Divorce lawyers?
"
," Ted: Wow, guys! You scared us.
"
," Ted: Well, we just had our first fight.
"
," Ted: A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building...
"
," Ted: And if we don't get it, we could go under.
"
," Ted: Yes.
"
," Ted: Bernard, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front.
"
," Ted: It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices.
"
," Ted: That wasn't one.
"
," Ted: Hey.
"
," Ted: How was your day?
"
," Ted: Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was?
"
," Ted: You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time.
"
," Ted: So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is Field of Dreams?
"
," Ted: How do you not like Field of Dreams?!
"
," Ted: Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.
"
," Ted: I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job.
"
," Ted: Carmen thinks so.
"
," Ted: I love it when you quote Scripture.
"
," Ted: Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.
"
," Ted: Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that?
"
," Ted: Solid point. She did have hair of gold.
"
," Ted: Mm-hmm.
"
," Ted: Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess.
"
," Ted: Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Erik invited me to this party we could all go to. Erik's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right?
"
," Ted: Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.
"
," Ted: I know you would. It's the job.
"
," Ted: Hell, yeah. I love clubs. I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight, kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum. But sure, let's go dancing.
"
," Ted: Wait, let me just check with my friend.
"
," Ted: Hey, Isaac. You up for some super loud, repetitive music that hasn't changed since the mid-90s?
"
," Ted: Let's go.
"
," Ted: And then I was all, ""No, Frank Gehry, you're on your own this time."" And that, my dear, was the end of that hack's career.
"
," Ted: That is one hell of a non sequitur.
"
," Ted: Well, I don't know. But I suppose I should at least give you a ride home. Hop on. (The girl jumps on Ted's back)
"
," Ted: Galloping.
"
," Ted: It is tonight. Whoo!
"
," Ted: Solid point. And she did have hair of gold.
"
," Ted: Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands.
"
," Ted: Excuse us for one second. (To Joann) Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder.
"
," Ted: Yeah, had to. See ya. (He leaves)
"
," Ted: Hey. What are you doing here?
"
," Ted: Thanks. So, uh... how was your night?
"
," Ted: You really want to hear about boring architect stuff?
"
," Ted: What? The best part's the last 20 minutes.
"
," Ted: Oh, I like the way you say that. Hey, you want to see the building that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate?
"
," Ted: Yes.
"
," Ted: You don't have to tell me. And, um... just for fun, I've... I've sort of been working on my own idea of what I think the building should be. What do you think?
"
," Ted: Thanks. It's not like it will ever come to anything.
"
," Ted: Okay, but I don't want you expecting 78 storeys or anything. (They kiss again)
"
," Ted: I want to press the button to blow up The Arcadian!
"
," Ted: I want to press it!
"
," Ted: Well, I ran into Zoey yesterday.
"
," Ted: Saving money. Making new friends. No downside.
"
," Ted: Well, I can tell you're really busy so I should... I'll let you go.
"
," Ted: Well, at first I wasn't sure, but then she said something that got me thinking.
"
," Ted: Don't worry, we're not. I just, I feel bad Zoey's having such a hard time.
"
," Ted: I'm not letting you press the button.
"
," Ted: You're not pressing the button! It's my button!
"
," Ted: Yeah... no. This morning I was talking to the foreman.
"
," Ted: You know, Rod, um, I'm loving that nickname, and I can tell it's totally affectionate, but, uh, I'd prefer Ted.
"
," Ted: 50,000 lightbulbs! What if this one's too bright? What if this one flickers and gives everyone a weird headache? Do you know how many people it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs?
"
," Ted: There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks?
"
," Ted: You can't keep saying you have one rule if they're always different rules.
"
," Ted: Hi, Marsh.
"
," Ted: Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run. (Ted leaves the Bar)
"
," Ted: Hi, Natalie. You want to get coffee sometime?
"
," Ted: Bro.
"
," Ted: But I can't reach the worst part. (He picks his phone and calls someone) Hi, Karen. Want to get coffee sometime?
"
," Ted: Keith, you want to get coffee sometime...?
"
," Ted: Amazing first date with Zoey! We met at the intersection... (The rest is unintelligible)
"
," Ted: Thanks, Julia! No, on second thought. (Clarence and Randall jumps on him, all three fall down)Ooh! Come on. What the hell?!
"
," Ted: I'm not freaking out over a lightbulb! I'm freaking out over 50,000 lightbulbs! I can't do this! I only got this job because you gave it to me, Audrey. I didn't earn it!
"
," Ted: You're right. (Ted stops an elderly woman who was about to enter the Intersection) Um, excuse me. Can you give this to the blonde sitting alone in there and tell her Ted's really sorry? Also... indirect sunlight. Don't overwater. Half a cup a week is more than enough. (The elderly woman enters and gives theflowers to a blonde sitting alone, but not the right one) No. Hi.
"
," Ted: You sure?
"
," Ted: Hey, new is always better, right?
"
," Ted: Geez, what now? (He goes inside, enters a room) I heard the groom needed me.
"
," Ted: Coat check girl.
"
," Ted:... hat cowboy. Listen, I need this job. I have no other option.
"
," Ted: I have not worked as hard to finish in a crappy job. Get me wrong, Terry.
"
," Ted: I pass this building, so I see you in three days.
"
," Ted: A hat-shaped building.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: I have to really work, so...
"
," Ted: Buy the costume. It is important to you. Tell him how you feel.
"
," Ted: I'm with you.
"
," Ted: What...
"
," Ted: Impossible, the presentation is tomorrow. These hats are not alone.
"
," Ted: Why do you want as I go on the roof? You made me a surprise party?
"
," Ted: Recently, you need two tries to get up from the couch.You can not skip it.
"
," Ted: Really.
"
," Ted: Right?
"
," Ted: She's here, Jacqueline. She looks at me.
"
," Ted: The goat.
"
," Ted: It's a wuss. Not food. (He takes the mop in the bathroom and closes the door behind him) How...?
"
," Ted: I'm with you.
"
," Ted: What...
"
," Ted: I think I love you.
"
," Ted: Mr. Goat? (He tries to open the bathroom but the door is closed) M. The goat? Enough. (He manages to enter) Crazy Goat. I do not understand your fascination with this mop. It should be normal with a brain the size of a...
"
," Ted: The hospital!
"
," Ted: It happened... you left a wild animal in our apartment. I've been attacked.
"
," Ted: ""The sweetest and adorable goat in the world""?
"
," Ted: It's the goat jumped on me! Can I go?
"
," Ted: Great, I'm late for my presentation. Thank you, Mr. Goat.
"
," Ted: There he is, gentlemen. Rib Town. Is it not? Is it not?
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Sven...
"
," Ted: It's a disaster. How I will recover?
"
," Ted: What does that mean?
"
," Ted: Because I have to be an architect. This is... That's the plan.
"
," Ted: So what, I should do anything?
"
," Ted: Really? Really? I just saved someone's life, and you guys are focusing on this?
"
," Ted: I didn't buy this to get a date.
"
," Ted: Okay.
"
," Ted: Wait, did you steal my dream journal?
"
," Ted: Suzanne, come on, this is important. We need you around for a long time. Without you, we'd have to find some other sex-fueled, depraved animal to entertain us.
"
," Ted: No. If you get a dog, I'm going to be the one stuck taking care of it.
"
," Ted: Really? And who watered the philodendron on your bookcase and sang it back to life?
"
," Ted: Uh, yeah, it's right in here... Scooby.
"
," Ted: Should have just let you get a dog.
"
," Ted: He's totally a dog.
"
," Ted: Uh, Scooby, the tag's still on your jeans.
"
," Ted: Good boy!
"
," Ted: Francis, it's fine. You said you wanted a dog and you got one. And the best part is, he got his shots.
"
," Ted: Nice job fetching those.
"
," Ted: Uh, yeah. We hope our nosiness doesn't give you ""paws.""
"
," Ted:Yes, how did you ""whisker"" off her feet? Shed a little light on the matter.
"
," Ted: So, moving from Canada, that transition must have been pretty ""ruff.""
"
," Ted: Go ahead. Give me your best. My life's an open book.
"
," Ted: I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed.
"
," Ted: 1998. Cleveland's Gund Arena, front row. Caught JC's shirt. What else you got?
"
," Ted: I suppose it's possible Theresa has real feelings for Nora.
"
," Ted: Once?
"
," Ted: Nope. Not even once.
"
," Ted: Not even if she's hot?
"
," Ted: I knew it. I knew it. I knew if you got a dog, I'd wind up taking care of it.
"
," Ted: Sandwich brownies?
"
," Ted: Truth. Hey. I have a question.
"
," Ted: What did Ethel mean when he said ""calzone""?
"
," Ted: Dude. Listen to me. You have nothing to be ashamed of. That calzone sounds amazing.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God. Scooby ate the whole tray. Wait. Where is he, anyway?
"
," Ted: He just walked out of the apartment. Someone must've left the door open.
"
," Ted: He's so smart. We should get him on Letterman doing tricks.
"
," Ted: Wait wait! Riley. Can you pick up some calzones?
"
," Ted: Great idea.
"
," Ted: Yeah! Maybe that's where Scooby went.
"
," Ted: Hi.
"
," Ted: It was just dinner with her sister Stella and her boyfriend.They married before us.
"
," Ted: It seems that the lamb is great here.
"
," Ted: Did you need protein. I take the lamb.
"
," Ted: New objective: Our marriage is to kick the ass of hers.Our marriage is to take the head of his, press it down the toilet and flush 20 times.
"
," Ted: Hard to know where is the problem.
"
," Ted: No, Stella, it should help. Pay for dinner. Do not worry.Taking Charge.
"
," Ted: We get married on Sunday? It is sure to be ready for this?
"
," Ted: I'm leaving. And I'm also... spontaneous. (He throws a glass of water on his face) I would not have done that.
"
," Ted: We need you to come, this is my marriage.
"
," Ted: This is my marriage. You gotta be there.
"
," Ted: It is.
"
," Ted: No time.
"
," Ted: Do we really have to rent the cars for tomorrow.
"
," Ted: Guys, Stella and I have a little problem.
"
," Ted: Actually, I spoke to Stephanie. It is a little late, but it will be there on time.
"
," Ted: Yes, of course.
"
," Ted: Can I help you? Are you happy. You like him.
"
," Ted: But no.
"
," Ted: Come on, we're friends. In addition, we already had our Thanksgiving last relapse, it is not old.
"
," Ted: She already has his ticket.
"
," Ted: It would not bother me. Tony is great. Invite him too.
"
," Ted: Gabriella will soon get on the plane. In addition, it unleashed a lot of work for that.
"
," Ted: What should I do?
"
," Ted: That's true, this is my best friend. Girl friend. My best friend girl.
"
," Ted: Aldrin Justice, the last word.
"
," Ted: I will not tell him to come.
"
," Ted: It's gonna be the worst phone call of all time.
"
," Ted: OK, Jim arrives. You know, I'm fine. The former should be able to go to weddings. I'll tell Stella to do with.
"
," Ted: What do you mean by ""delicate""?
"
," Ted: What do I do?
"
," Ted: And if there is no other crises?
"
," Ted: There is a new crisis.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: So, first thing tomorrow I'm going to talk to him, convince him to let me take Lucy, then boom, crisis solved. Stella is happy. Darryl comes to marriage.
"
," Ted: We did a little karate?
"
," Ted: OK.
"
," Ted: Not yet. Soon.
"
," Ted: Actually, I've already had s*x many times. Why I always corrects people?
"
," Ted: Look, here's the thing...
"
," Ted: Tony, stop. It is also a great day for Lucy. You'll have to put your problems aside and think about what is best for her.Whether you like it or not, it really should be the wedding of his mother. I take Lucy with me.
"
," Ted: Let's cuddle.
"
," Ted: But you're part of.
"
," Ted: You are now.
"
," Ted: Let me talk to Stella first.
"
," Ted: To be fair... your ex is here.
"
," Ted: Come on, it's not weird.
"
," Ted: You can talk to Tony? Jessie made the trip from Tokyo. I should talk to him.
"
," Ted: Sorry to have run away like that.
"
," Ted: You can not come to the wedding.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: It's not weird.
"
," Ted: It was broken, there is more than a year.
"
," Ted: So, I was your backup plan. It's flattering.
"
," Ted: Why do you mention that? There was nothing between us.
"
," Ted: It's true. We went out together, but... we have moved on.And we got what we wanted. I marry, You have the job of your dreams in Tokyo. And they lived happily...
"
," Ted: You what?
"
," Ted: What does that mean?
"
," Ted: I did the rain.
"
," Ted: I love Stella. This is good. If you feel it all... I think it is good that you come to the marriage.
"
," Ted: Okay, first of all, you look like the last pick in the draft. And, second, why are you so excited about some bank?
"
," Ted: So, what do you guys want to do for dinner?
"
," Ted: Really? You want to eat here?
"
," Ted: Wait. What about sushi?
"
," Ted: I had Italian for lunch.
"
," Ted: Chinese?
"
," Ted: Indian?
"
," Ted: Indian isn't Chinese.
"
," Ted: Mexican?
"
," Ted: It's like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's. Where the chef killed it and ran it through the meat grinder.
"
," Ted: You are being ridiculous. (Taking the bat.) Tell me, you left the apartment today?
"
," Ted: Jennie, you have to get over this paranoia. You are not gonna get mugged.
"
," Ted: That's it, you're taking a walk. Come on, go.
"
," Ted: Go outside, go, go.
"
," Ted: Leave the bat.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
"
," Ted: I want one of those burgers right now! Do you think they're still open?
"
," Ted: We didn't know our way around. Just getting back to the apartment took us three hours and one very helpful drag queen.
"
," Ted: There was that one time we thought we had a break in the case, remember?
"
," Ted: We should probably call Regis.
"
," Ted: Oh my god. I'm never brushing my teeth again unless it's with a toothbrush made from this burger.
"
," Ted: Allison, you might not want to hear this, but... is it at all possible this is the same
"
," Ted: Tell them about the underpants.
"
," Ted: Everyone's got an underpants radius. For most of us, it's the distance from the bedroom to the bathroom, but as your self-esteem gets smaller, your underpants radius gets bigger.
"
," Ted: Come on, Gordon, he'll find a job eventually.
"
," Ted: Shawn, I think we're all eating that burger.
"
," Ted: What? Uptown? Where?
"
," Ted: It's not a burger place anymore; it's a Goliath National Bank ATM.
"
," Ted: We can't eat here. It's an ATM.
"
," Ted: Cory, no!
"
," Ted: Give it.
"
," Ted: Give it!
"
," Ted: I have any cash.
"
," Ted: All right, Erica, remember. It might not taste as good. This place has changed, you've changed, New York has changed. Just... don't get your hopes up too high, okay?
"
," Ted: Okay.
"
," Ted: a tramp stamp?!
"
," Ted: Say goodbye, kids, 'cause it won't be around much longer. (He shows his tattoo)
"
," Ted: yes, yes, enjoy these final moments of mockery because in just ten surprisingly expensive sessions, Stella is gonna zap that butterfly right off the face of my lower back.
"
," Ted: Dr Stella Zinman. She's the best in the business. And she's rather cute in fact. In fact... we're going to a movie together tonight.
"
," Ted: I asked her out.
"
," Ted: What? What do you mean?
"
," Ted: oh, no, this doesn't count.
"
," Ted: uh, actually, it's ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" It's from the bible.
"
," Ted: Well, that's cute. But she's not my neighbor, she's my doctor. So if you'll excuse me...
"
," Ted: This is NYC.You don't get close to the neighbors. You nod at them politely in the hall. You call the cops if you haven't seen them in a while and you smell something funny, and that is it.
"
," Ted: Nelson, we love this bar. If you screxw over Wendy the waitress, you're going to kill the bar.
"
," Ted: yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.
"
," Ted: Look, Stella and i are adults; we're both smart, mature people capable of making good decisions.
"
," Ted: We're just seeing a movie. If it seems at all weird, i'll back off.
"
," Ted: See, i bet you didn't pay for that gin and tonic.
"
," Ted: But you got to admit, there is an upside to breaking the platinum rule. Like maybe as her boyfrien, i could get a discount on treatments.
"
," Ted: We like this bar.
"
," Ted: Renee, we love this bar.
"
," Ted: This bar is like home to us.
"
," Ted: Yeah, listen i'm leaving so if you want to write the rest of these down, i will read it tomorrow.
"
," Ted: You want to get out of the way?
"
," Ted: Don't do this Ted. Don't (He brushes his hair in a mess)
"
," Ted: Dude! ya! It was perfect! You're such a jerk!
"
," Ted: You've got a whole meat locker at home full of corpses, don't you?
"
," Ted: yeah, this metaphor's really falling apart.
"
," Ted: guys, are you here? I forgot my keys. Can you open up?
"
," Ted: Hello? Guys? (Arnold looks again and see the Gerards go out their apartment)
"
," Ted: waouh. I've got to hand it to Wendy the waitress that was very mature of her.
"
," Ted: What? You're being ridiculous.
"
," Ted: What are you talking about?
"
," Ted: Uh, that you're letting yourself believe she's crazy so you don't have to face the far more likely possibility that she doesn't want to date you either?
"
," Ted: I don't know, i guess Wendy the Waitress brought it to him.
"
," Ted: All right, i'm taking off.
"
," Ted: I have a date. (Isaiah brushes Ted's hair in a mess)
"
," Ted: You're such a jerk!
"
," Ted: Well, i'm sick of all the rules! There's too many of them! The hot/crazy scale, the lemon law, the platinum rule! If everyone in the world followed every one of your rules, the human race would cease to exist. Yes chances are to Stella and I are not going to live happily ever after the overwhelming odds have it ending badly. And when that happens, it'll be for one of a million possible reasons. But that doesn't mean i'm not gonna try. And when it does fail, so help me god, it's not gonna be because of some rule. (He watches himself in th mirror) PS: you just made my hair look awesome. Good night. (He leaves)
"
," Ted: She thought we were seeing a movie just as friends.
"
," Ted: Apparently, there's a rule that says i can't date Stella.
"
," Ted: No, this rule comes from the american medical association. Doctors aren't legally allowed to date their patients.
"
," Ted: It's okay. What are you guys watching?
"
," Ted: Why does Arron do anything ever?
"
," Ted: I don't know. This does have all the earmarks of p0rn. Stripper pole, bad lighting, delusional girl who thinks it's a stepping stone to mainstream success.
"
," Ted: Evan, this show is so dirty, I don't know whether to hug you or run a shower for you so you can sit there alone, crying and clenching your knees.
"
," Ted: I'm still friends with Punchy.
"
," Ted: Look, I may not see him a lot, but it doesn't matter. Observe.
"
," Ted: Punchy!
"
," Ted: Yeah, you, too. If you're ever in New York.
"
," Ted: We are just two peas.
"
," Ted: Much like our friends, the Space Teens, I think I can solve this crime with math. Okay... Okay, here is a Christmas card that Jessica sent Shane. Carolyn, how old would you say that kid is?
"
," Ted: Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago. Right around the time she and Rita stopped being friends.
"
," Ted: Thus, if I may... When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear, Lee said, ""To hell with this, I'm outta hare. Glitter got pregnant, so Lee dumped her.
"
," Ted: When a second uterus plumped becomes...
"
," Ted: We've been waiting all day!
"
," Ted: Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse.
"
," Ted: Sure.
"
," Ted: Punchy, what are you doing here?
"
," Ted: Okay, uh, uh, where are you staying?
"
," Ted: Come on. I worry about the guy. He's had the same dead-end job at a car rental place for 15 years.
"
," Ted: He's been stuck in Cleveland his whole life.
"
," Ted: Reginald... LeBron.
"
," Ted: Um, hello, somebody already solved that crime using math, remember?
"
," Ted: Yeah. You know, there's more to New York than Times Square. There's the Village, the Lower East Side, Central Park...
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: Here. You know what? Hold this, okay?
"
," Ted: Okay, yeah. I know.
"
," Ted: That's your scrotum.
"
," Ted: Yeah, he's gotta go.
"
," Ted: Punchy, it's time to go back.
"
," Ted: Uh, no. Back-Back to Cleveland.
"
," Ted: You worry about me?
"
," Ted: Punchy!
"
," Ted: Yeah. You, too. If you're ever in New York...
"
," Ted: Wow. She sounds pretty great, Punchy.
"
," Ted: Wow! Wow! That's... I'm-I'm really happy for you.
"
," Ted: Of course I will.
"
," Ted: Me, too.
"
," Ted: Yeah, dude, come on.
"
," Ted: Did I ever! Deadliest Catch ever!
"
," Ted: That sucks. I've been there, buddy.
"
," Ted: With her new hippie husband, Clint. The comfort of home is a little ruined when someone turns your old room into what I'm pretty sure is a Tantric s*x temple. With all the bamboo, pot smoke and '60s music, it's like my old G.I. Joes are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback.
"
," Ted: Same.
"
," Ted: No one believes that story.
"
," Ted: Yeah, that's what your mom said.
"
," Ted: No, she actually said that.
"
," Ted: How you doing?
"
," Ted: Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. What did you say?
"
," Ted: Guilty.
"
," Ted: Who, me?
"
," Ted: Really?
"
," Ted: Everett, how can I possibly live up to that review?
"
," Ted: But that is not the point. I mean, you broke the first rule of setting people up: undersell. It's like, if someone's never seen The Karate Kid, you don't say, ""It's the greatest movie ever."" You say, ""Uh, it's pretty good"" And then they see it, it blows their freakin' mind. Because Cobra Kai sensei's all like, ""Sweep the leg!"" And Daniel-san's all like... (high-pitched vocalizations, (mitates whooshing sounds)
"
," Ted: Damn. Loretta really lied a lot to her kids.
"
," Ted: I always find that reassuring.
"
," Ted: You think so?
"
," Ted: How?
"
," Ted: Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect. That totally takes the pressure...
"
," Ted: See, now you went too far in the other...
"
," Ted: Stop!
"
," Ted: ""Ted Mosby is solid as a rock."" No. ""Dependable."" No. ""Rugged."" No.
"
," Ted: I just want to hit that perfect middle ground.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Oh, no.
"
," Ted: No, they won't. They're going to think... Wait. ""Everyone""?
"
," Ted: Wait. Yvonne and James are two years apart. If Sam only knew Loretta for a few months, he couldn't possibly be Yvonne's father.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl.
"
," Ted: Weird day.
"
," Ted: I guess. Wait a minute. You said Liz was a total ten. Why would she want to meet the incontinent freak show you described? You oversold her!
"
," Ted: You said she was a ten.
"
," Ted: You said she looked like a movie star.
"
," Ted: I had the most amazing night ever.
"
," Ted: Edna.
"
," Ted: I'm guessing you haven't always had this rule.
"
," Ted: Exactly. Exactly, like, like just now, when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there, I'm not gonna lie to you, big time thunderbolt.
"
," Ted: Sadly not out of character. But I know now it's just a mirage.
"
," Ted: Exactly. And that, in a nutshell, is why I'm not putting the moves on you.
"
," Ted: What, you think this is the moves? Believe me, you'd know the moves. People ten tables away would know the moves.
"
," Ted: Tell me about it.
"
," Ted: Interested.
"
," Ted: Less interested.
"
," Ted: Go ahead.
"
," Ted: What are you saying?
"
," Ted: Unless...
"
," Ted: Wow. OK, I'm in.
"
," Ted: I guess, what, we'll need fake names?
"
," Ted: Pleased to meet you, Buttercup. I'm Lando Calrissian.
"
," Ted: Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded...
"
," Ted: So, I'm Ted.
"
," Ted: No last names.
"
," Ted: No, it was awesome. I had a great night, I'm never gonna see her again, and there's no way to ruin it.
"
," Ted: That cake really got to you, huh?
"
," Ted: Mm-hm.
"
," Ted: Yes, but we'll need a diversion.
"
," Ted: Kiss.
"
," Ted: Go. Go, go, go
"
," Ted: You're not gonna do it at your wedding?
"
," Ted: Very nice.
"
," Ted: I couldn't really tell.
"
," Ted: Well, it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight.
"
," Ted: No you couldn't.
"
," Ted: Totally get some.
"
," Ted: I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.
"
," Ted: OK.
"
," Ted: OK.
"
," Ted: She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and we connected on every level. And, I'm never gonna see her again.
"
," Ted: Dammit, I have to see her again.
"
," Ted: Nothing. Her name's Victoria, that's all I got. Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know.
"
," Ted: Yes, two weeks, good idea. I'm calling her now.
"
," Ted: I've moved on.
"
," Ted: Uh, no, her name was Victoria, I don't know her last name.
"
," Ted: Thank God.
"
," Ted: There was no Victoria at the wedding.
"
," Ted: Lois. She was not a ghost.
"
," Ted: Wait, wait, wait, she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids. She must have been at their table. Maybe they know who she was?
"
," Ted: Uh, listen, Dwayne, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?
"
," Ted: Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me.
"
," Ted: Why not?
"
," Ted: OK, Edward, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.
"
," Ted: I'm ready to be proven wrong.
"
," Ted: Actually.
"
," Ted: So, what do you want to do next?
"
," Ted: Don't think...first thing that comes into your mind.
"
," Ted: Whoa. There she goes.
"
," Ted: I understand.
"
," Ted: No, you know what? This is fate. I am never supposed to see this girl again. That was the whole point of the night. I've just been saved from myself. Let's drink many beers.
"
," Ted: Hey.
"
," Ted: Sure. What's up?
"
," Ted: Oh.
"
," Ted: Hello.
"
," Ted: It's fine, Claudia. Don't worry about it.
"
," Ted: Oh, um, Patsy wanted to know where you guys got that cake.
"
," Ted: She made the cake.
"
," Ted: Buttercup Bakery. She wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest. She made the cake.
"
," Ted: I'm going down to that bakery.
"
," Ted: Yeah, all day long, you've been busting my apple bag about finding this girl.
"
," Ted: Going. Getting.
"
," Ted: Yes! No.
"
," Ted: Whoa. Guess we were gone a while.
"
," Ted: Why yes I am. Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking.
"
," Ted: Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.
"
," Ted: You know, I don't look like this every day. On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.
"
," Ted: Tell me your last name.
"
," Ted: You know, there's one little flaw in our plan.
"
," Ted: I'm gonna go home tonight with a lot of great memories and one really sucky memory: the memory of you walking out that door.
"
," Ted: Yeah?
"
," Ted: One, two, three, four, five.
"
," Ted: And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be...
"
," Ted: OK.
"
," Ted: It looks good. I'll do.
"
," Ted: I saw in the fridge.
"
," Ted: So, throw it.
"
," Ted: So, take out the trash.
"
," Ted: You know, when I asked you to be my roommate, I said, ""A girl, she will be careful."" But no, you're an ogre Revenge of the Nerds.
"
," Ted: Damn, I can not. I'm busy leave a plate of cookies for the elf magic puts toilet paper. Wait, there's no elf. It's always me!
"
," Ted: This is ridiculous!
"
," Ted: I know. It's been what?
"
," Ted: As Nicholas's theory on world peace?
"
," Ted: All international conflicts?
"
," Ted: So, the crisis in the Middle East could be solved by...
"
," Ted: Apartheid?
"
," Ted: The Cold War?
"
," Ted: Well, I think we should love again.
"
," Ted: Biking upside down. Well, listen. If it should happen on occasion, they say nothing to anyone. Sold.
"
," Ted: No. It was just love to do more fighting.
"
," Ted: I understand. No problem.
"
," Ted: So, this is wasted time.
"
," Ted: We talked and we realized we had some difficult months.It deserves a little fun.
"
," Ted: Rule number one: purely physical relationship. There are no feelings.
"
," Ted: And since it's just physical, it was not to worry love.
"
," Ted: Absolutely! Let's multitasking. Use s*x to spice up the boring activities.
"
," Ted: Paying the bills.
"
," Ted: It's not very hygienic.
"
," Ted: Problem solved. In fact, the credit goes to Ella. This idea just your thing on the world peace.
"
," Ted: There's something liberating not to take it seriously.
"
," Ted: I think so. You still have drank all my milk!
"
," Ted: OK.
"
," Ted: This is the ideal plan. Each time you start to yell, he lieth in place. One minute you're on the back of each other, and the one after that, well, the same thing.
"
," Ted: This morning, she cried through the door, ""You're too long in the shower! "". A second later, she joined me. There, it has not bothered me to take my time.
"
," Ted: Sorry for the delay. I was typing a Scherbatsky. She used all my stamps, so in short, the postman rang twice. Should you stamp it!
"
," Ted: Hello.
"
," Ted: It was fun last night.
"
," Ted: Okay, see you later.
"
," Ted: Last night, Enrique left a pizza box lying on the floor, so we had s*x three times.
"
," Ted: And this morning before leaving for work... we kissed.
"
," Ted: What? This kiss has violated the spirit of our arrangement. She probably thinks that I have feelings for her.
"
," Ted: No. It meant nothing. It was just a reflex when we were a couple. But I did everything go wrong.
"
," Ted: I have to stop it.
"
," Ted: I think so.
"
," Ted: I do not either.
"
," Ted: Colocs.
"
," Ted: But they say nothing to anyone. Okay?
"
," Ted: Seriously!
"
," Ted: It did not last long.
"
," Ted: What are you doing?
"
," Ted: Thanks, I guess. You want a beer?
"
," Ted: You have bought us a dishwasher?
"
," Ted: So you take it all and you can avoid to argue, eh?
"
," Ted: It bothers you that we sleep together, right?
"
," Ted: You're in love with Veronica? You're in love with Veronica.That's why you not want people sleeping together.
"
," Ted: Cite me a buddy in the story of friends who has already done that.
"
," Ted: That thing between me and Delores is completely innocent.I flipperai if you tell me not feel something for her. This is the case?
"
," Ted: Are you sure?
"
," Ted: Positive?
"
," Ted: Jen?
"
," Ted: It's nice to meet you, too.
"
," Ted: Wait a second, the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" exhibit's inMontreal this year. Everyone knows that. Where are you taking me?
"
," Ted: Stop the cab.
"
," Ted: So, Jen, what do you do?
"
," Ted: I'm an architect. Hopefully, one day, I can use my own humble brush on the masterpiece that isManhattan's skyline.
"
," Ted: I teach architecture. Get 50% off so, that's pretty sweet.
"
," Ted:  Yeah, I can't talk right now.
"
," Ted: Uh, look, I got to go. Take a picture.
"
," Ted: (hanging up his cellular) Sorry about that.
"
," Ted: Yeah, do you wanna share the oysters?
"
," Ted:  Good. 'Cause if you didn't......that would be mighty shellfish.
"
," Ted: That's why it's funny!
"
," Ted: We've been on this exact blind date before.
"
," Ted: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that blind date went too well.
"
," Ted: Wait, you... You dressur cats up in weird costumes.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God. Do you realize what this means? Since our first date, we've done a complete lap of all the single people inNew York only to end up back here, with each other.
"
," Ted: Well, you've got your cats.
"
," Ted: Wait, I got to ask. Why did you think I was snobby?
"
," Ted: Main Lobster. They spelled ""Maine"" without the ""e."" Good to know we're not getting the crappy understudy lobsters, right? Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half lobster will be played by...
"
," Ted: Huh. I had no idea.
"
," Ted: That's right-- the check. The check came and, of course, I was going to pay, but you didn't do the check dance.
"
," Ted: This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. 'Cause let's be honest, we are scaring people off, Jen.
"
," Ted: Great.
"
," Ted: I think we went to MacLaren's.
"
," Ted: All right, so what did I do wrong next? Let me have it. I'm here to learn.
"
," Ted: Not really.
"
," Ted: I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that.
"
," Ted: I couldn't admit I was cold. I didn't want to seem like a wimp compared to your action hero ex-boyfriend who you wouldn't stop talking about.
"
," Ted: I had an aunt in the Coast Guard.
"
," Ted: See? Why didn't you lead off with that?
"
," Ted: Remember? (showing the Mc Laren's bar)
"
," Ted: You loved them.
"
," Ted: Let's go in and see what they remember. And they are my best friends, so don't be surprised if they suddenly ""can't think"" of anything I do wrong.
"
," Ted: Me?
"
," Ted: (looking at the girl) Nice.
"
," Ted: Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! I remember that. I was not checking out a girl.
"
," Ted: Nice.
"
," Ted: We were checking out Moustache Gertrude.
"
," Ted: Yeah, well, it's nice to know ""past me"" wasn't a total jackass, huh?
"
," Ted: You got it.
"
," Ted: ...and there's theChryslerBuilding. And the Empire State Building. And at 12:00, a rotund couple going at it against the glass.
"
," Ted: Good for them. Letting a guy eat pizza off your back, that's love. So, um... I know this wasn't the best

," Ted: That was really great. Wh... What went wrong?
"
," Ted: Yeah. So would you maybe, um... want to go out again?
"
," Ted: Absolutely.
"
," Ted: Promise.
"
," Ted: I have been so busy.
"
," Ted: Jen, I sorry. Look, I know I'm seven years late with this call, but I was an idiot back then. You saw the goatee. The truth is, I had a great time tonight, and I'd love to see you again.
"
," Ted: Look, Jen, I wish I could go back and talk some sense into 2002 Ted, but that guy's a lost cause. He's 24. He thinks a little facial hair makes him look like John Depp. And he has no idea what a great girl he's missing out on. But I've learned a lot since then. I've learned a lot tonight.
"
," Ted: No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently... who knows what
"
," Ted: I just remembered why I didn't call you.
"
," Ted: I can't believe I'm gonna screw this up again, but, um... I like finding typos in menus.
"
," Ted: And I know my shellfish pun is stupid but the truth... I'm not suddenly gonna stop making stupid jokes.
"
," Ted: Shouldn't we hold out for the person who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks, but actually kind of likes them? Even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other, seven years from now?
"
," Ted: Well... good luck out there, Jen.
"
," Ted: Nice! Where'd you get this?
"
," Ted: And also with you. Man, this is what church has been missing. Dude, you fixed church.
"
," Ted: What? No. I'm just hoping it doesn't rain. Why? Do I look nervous?
"
," Ted: Jenny, I really... I have to grade these papers.
"
," Ted: A sun dress.
"
," Ted: I really have to get this done.
"
," Ted: Thank you.
"
," Ted: Okay, I'll tell you. Just... There's a... There's a girl sitting at the bar. Don't look!
"
," Ted: Okay, you can look. Just-just-just be cool for once.
"
," Ted: And what's that word?
"
," Ted: What... You can't call dibs on a girl I've been sitting here thinking about maybe talking to eventually at some point.
"
," Ted: Dibs were implied.
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: Look, I don't have time for a fake history lesson, so I'll keep this simple. You go over there and talk to that girl, I will see you in court.
"
," Ted: Damn it!
"
," Ted: You know what? To hell with your dibs. I'm going over there right now and talking to her.
"
," Ted: Actually, Andrea would probably be...
"
," Ted: No!
"
," Ted: I had implied dibs.
"
," Ted: Fine. Have at it. Exercise your dibs. She's got her shields up anyway. She's reading a book.
"
," Ted: You know what, Flenn? Just cut her some slack, okay? She just went through a breakup.
"
," Ted: Here, have some tea.
"
," Ted: Judd, I am here for you. Whatever you need.
"
," Ted: Try? I will absolutely say no. Our friendship is too important.
"
," Ted: It was a tough summer, but I think our girl's been a real trooper. She's... Is this a Cheeto?
"
," Ted: Hey Joyce, what do you think? The girl sitting at the bar. Shields up?
"
," Ted: Hey! How'd it go? You pregnant yet?
"
," Ted: I feel you, buddy.
"
," Ted: Okay, Noah. What's this going to cost me?
"
," Ted: Your dibs. I want to buy your dibs.
"
," Ted: 20 bucks.
"
," Ted: No. (He takes $20 out of his wallet)
"
," Ted: All right. Wish me luck.
"
," Ted: That girl she's talking to? I dated her.
"
," Ted: I got to see her ankles.
"
," Ted: What kind of guy? A cheesy guy or a cool guy?
"
," Ted: Oh, man! That guy is cool. His hair's all cool, he's got a cool belt.
"
," Ted: Oh, God, this sucks! Do you think she saw me?
"
," Ted: Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her.
"
," Ted: Or set me up with one of your friends. No, I'm kidding. That would be weird.
"
," Ted: It wouldn't, would it? Any one of those three. Whichever's easiest and right nearby. And not the beer.
"
," Ted: Totally.
"
," Ted: Her words exactly.
"
," Ted: She didn't see us high-six, did she?
"
," Ted: Yeah, let's never do that again.
"
," Ted: I'm doing this. I am going over there. Wish me luck.
"
," Ted: Okay, maybe I'm a little nervous.
"
," Ted: I know. I just... I want it to be great, you know? I want this whole day to be great.
"
," Ted: Geez, what now?
"
," Ted: Yeah. You were saying?
"
," Ted: No. I didn't bring an umbrella.
"
," Ted: No! Of course! Absolutely!
"
," Ted: With Elizabeth we went to the objects found in the prefecture and there, sitting in their fridge... Is this your turkey?
"
," Ted: You have done the same for us.
"
," Ted: You're saying...
"
," Ted: Me too. She speaks little, but that thing with his father gave him much trouble.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Seriously Douglas, you should have the slap. You're a big baffeuse. In fact, I want to study the slaps in your tutoring. I wanna be your apprentice-slap.
"
," Ted: The Throne of Baffe.
"
," Ted: No. To you, I insist.
"
," Ted: Great. Wait, what?
"
," Ted: What, so it's... the end of the discussion?
"
," Ted: I was polite. If someone will slap, it will be me.
"
," Ted: Let me do it. It was my idea to call the objects found in the prefecture.
"
," Ted: I brought this large turkey so far.
"
," Ted: You've slept with one of my best friends!
"
," Ted: Well, no!
"
," Ted: Because I love you always!
"
," Ted: I really want to slap!
"
," Ted: Claudia sh1t! I knew Hannah first. This is for me to slap.
"
," Ted: I want to slap Clinton since I met him!
"
," Ted: One second. This slap was supposed to be a wonderful thing, a gift, and it has turned against each other.
"
," Ted: Are you sure?
"
," Ted: It's decided. Veronica, go. Come on the throne.
"
," Ted: Yep. Go.
"
," Ted: Do not listen. It's decided.
"
," Ted: Tomothy! Pull yourself together! (The timer sounds and ""something sprung from the game) What just happened?
"
," Ted: You have swallowed this painting?
"
," Ted: What? Why me?
"
," Ted: Thank you.
"
," Ted: You just go through a break... and even though I know that you and Caleb are remained on good terms, there is not a part of you, well hidden that wants to slap in the face?
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: Okay.
"
," Ted: I do not either.
"
," Ted: Yeah, that's right...a limo.
"
," Ted: Okay, people, let's talk strategy. Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked. This year we party together or not at all. Now, I sifted through your party submission and I narrowed them down to these five.
"
," Ted: Yes, Norma, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.
"
," Ted: We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City and that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year.
"
," Ted: Oh, she works in my office. She seems like she might be into me. She's always finding reasons to hug me. So tonight...
"
," Ted: I am definitely getting psyched.
"
," Ted: Yes! Let's! Oh, driver?
"
," Ted: Oh, we rode in his cab one time. It's a long story.
"
," Ted: See ya next year. Go get 'em.
"
," Ted: Okay, nobody get down. We knew this going in. We're a man down. That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder. Ranjit! Party number one.
"
," Ted: Hey, we've got four more parties to hit. If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.
"
," Ted: So, Beverly, who's your new friend?
"
," Ted: Come on, Herminia, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us. I need you to power through the pain.
"
," Ted: Ranjit! Party number two.
"
," Ted: Party number two? Not so good.
"
," Ted: No, no turning back. Ranjit, party number three.
"
," Ted: I'm sorry about Derrick.
"
," Ted: Me, too. (Ted's phone starts ringing) Hey, Ben.
"
," Ted: Ranjit, turn it around.
"
," Ted: No, this is perfect. It's meant to be. We're all back together.
"
," Ted: Look, Luis, you're not going home. Come on, it's New Year's Eve. Look, so your date fell through. So what? What do you need a date for? Someone to kiss at midnight? Fine. I'll kiss you at... a little bit after midnight.
"
," Ted: That's it. I know what you're jonesing for. Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!
"
," Ted: Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.
"
," Ted: What? No!
"
," Ted: Ranjit, party number three.
"
," Ted: Hey. I'll bet you're feeling better now.
"
," Ted: No way.
"
," Ted: Should I say something? I should say something, right? Moby! Hey, Moby!
"
," Ted: Hey.
"
," Ted: What's up? Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?
"
," Ted: You want a ride?
"
," Ted: Welcome.
"
," Ted: Yeah, we'd love to.
"
," Ted: Um... Moby, switch up, will you? Yeah, what's up?
"
," Ted: Call her.
"
," Ted: That's New Year's Eve for you. Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards...
"
," Ted: But... Come on! Moby's party! Moby's party! Moby's par... Ranjit. Moby's party.
"
," Ted: You're not Moby, are you?
"
," Ted: So your name is Tony?
"
," Ted: Nah.
"
," Ted: I don't know. I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.
"
," Ted: Gerald, you have to get out of there this instant. That's not Moby.
"
," Ted: Run! Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four. What are the odds?
"
," Ted: Ranjit, drive!
"
," Ted: Party number three!
"
," Ted: No, no, no, no you were at party number four. You must have looked at the list wrong.
"
," Ted: Brennan, Brennan, Brennan, it's not worth it! Let it go. We need to get back on schedule.
"
," Ted: Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?
"
," Ted: Okay Okay, not a problem. He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time.
"
," Ted: It'll be fine. We'll be out of here in a jiff.
"
," Ted: No. Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but...
"
," Ted: I'm not in love... We're just friends. Where are you getting that from?
"
," Ted: That's ridiculous. Wait. Really?
"
," Ted: Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party. It's no big deal.
"
," Ted: But he left his phone.
"
," Ted: Sorry about your guy.
"
," Ted: I did not, too.
"
," Ted: I'll give you some privacy.
"
," Ted: Okay, how's this for a plan? We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45. We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time.
"
," Ted: Give what a rest?
"
," Ted: Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around. We've still got ten minutes.
"
," Ted: Holy crap.
"
," Ted: Not Moby's party?
"
," Ted: How? We'll never get a cab.
"
," Ted: Let's do this! Come on! In! Go, go, go!
"
," Ted: Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town. Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?
"
," Ted: Ranjit, put her in park. Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome, but it's not the best party in New York. 'Cause this is, right here.
"
," Ted: Hey, uh, come on in.
"
," Ted: What about your guy? It's midnight. Go kiss him.
"
," Ted: Well, a deal is a deal.
"
," Ted: Happy New Year.
"
," Ted: Not how much? What.
"
," Ted: You want a good holiday drink, try his Kwanzaapolitan.
"
," Ted: So, Lil, Alexis's family. Whole weekend with the future in-laws, you excited?
"
," Ted: You just did it again.
"
," Ted: No, I have to work on Friday. You?
"
," Ted: Oh, right, I forgot you guys are weird. You pronounce the word out, ""oat""
"
," Ted: Your cops are called Mounties.
"
," Ted: No, Dale's got his own Thanksgiving tradition.
"
," Ted: I think I'm gonna go to a homeless shelter, serve food.
"
," Ted: Yeah, I thought I'd just spend the day giving back, you know, doing some good.
"
," Ted: Exactly.
"
," Ted: I know. I'm so psyched we did this. Look at all these people, giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man. These have got to be the best people in New York.
"
," Ted: Alyssa?
"
," Ted: What are you doing here?
"
," Ted: But you're Satan.
"
," Ted: Wait, so, this is real. Alice does this?
"
," Ted: Anyway, uh, we're psyched to be here, Kendall. What do you need us to do?
"
," Ted: Hey, Barn? What do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit?
"
," Ted: This is crazy. When did it get so hard to do charity work?
"
," Ted: Ha ha. Delightful. How is that little project coming along anyway?
"
," Ted: What? That's crazy, I haven't been staring at any girl...
"
," Ted: Hi, I'm the aforementioned Ted, and this is...
"
," Ted:... gone.
"
," Ted: Hi.
"
," Ted: Well, I've been...nothing. I do nothing.
"
," Ted: So, Amanda, what do you need us to do?
"
," Ted: Got it. Consider it sorted.
"
," Ted: Hey, Elaine's not gonna get all the glory today.
"
," Ted: Let's start with this one.
"
," Ted: Hey, Amanda, what's this box for?
"
," Ted: In your car, um, then you'll take it...
"
," Ted: People donated this food thinking it was going to feed the hungry.
"
," Ted: Flenn.
"
," Ted: You have a time sheet. No one else has a time sheet.
"
," Ted: All right, let me see that.
"
," Ted: Court-mandated community service.
"
," Ted: You peed on a church?
"
," Ted: Oh, you are evil.
"
," Ted: Kendall, ah, Kendall, Amanda is stealing Portobello mushrooms from homeless people.
"
," Ted: Those are for the hungry.
"
," Ted: Mushrooms. Mushrooms. Portobello mushrooms for everybody! Take them and run! They're very expensive!
"
," Ted: You can't fire a volunteer.
"
," Ted: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just tell me, I'll do it.
"
," Ted: Public urination. Who gets arrested for public urination?
"
," Ted: You wanna know why I have to work tomorrow? My firm's designing an executive lounge for a tobacco company. In the fight against cancer, I'm on the side of cancer.
"
," Ted: Are you joking?
"
," Ted: No, Wyatt, that's insane. Sir, would you like me to buy you a ticket to the buffet.
"
," Ted: You know, I don't think I'm gonna watch.
"
," Ted: Here you go, Walter. Happy Thanksgiving.
"
," Ted: Happy Thanksgiving, guys.
"
," Ted: Uh, no thanks. You want some yams?
"
," Ted: I'm Ted.
"
," Ted: Still Ted.
"
," Ted: Hey, Punchy, I've given this some serious thought. I think I know how we can crush these floral arrangements.
"
," Ted: Peonies, lavender blossoms with a halo of baby's breath for an ambiance of springtime rejuvenation.
"
," Ted: It's gonna be a magical day. (Ted hangs up) I know what you're thinking. I wish I was a dude.
"
," Ted: Because if I was a dude, I could have Ted Mosby as my best man.
"
," Ted: Uh, are you forgetting I've done this before? I was Delores's best man.
"
," Ted: Oh, come on. That wasn't my fault. And need I remind you, I gave a beautiful toast.
"
," Ted: Uh, yeah. It's hard to take criticism from someone who just recorded seven episodes of Million Dollar Heads or Tails.
"
," Ted: Why this sudden obsession with Heads or Tails?
"
," Ted: You mean coin flip bimbo?
"
," Ted: You auditioned, didn't you?
"
," Ted: You're the new coin flip bimbo?
"
," Ted: Isaac, you better check yourself before you trebek yourself. You're a journalist! What is the matter with you?
"
," Ted: Carlos, have you forgotten about your New Year's resolution?
"
," Ted: No, before that.
"
," Ted: Before that, too.
"
," Ted: I thought you finally got that interview at World Wide News.
"
," Ted: Which could be a stepping stone to bigger things in your career.
"
," Ted: What changed your mind?
"
," Ted: You took the Heads or tails job?
"
," Ted: What about World Wide News, your I.D. badge? You made a New Year's resolution.
"
," Ted: We're seeing a Christmas movie. It's a Christmas-themed movie snack.
"
," Ted: Where the hell is Jacqueline?
"
," Ted: Bon Jovi?
"
," Ted: My God, Leslie! I work for GNB, too. All I got was $15 gift card to Costa Coffee.
"
," Ted: Uh, has it ever occurred to you to give some of this to charity?
"
," Ted: Let me guess. You got a huge bonus check, too.
"
," Ted: Thirty?!
"
," Ted: No. No! I cannot go back to that strip club. I seen some things.
"
," Ted: What happened to giving the money away?
"
," Ted: It's a Christmas-themed movie snack!
"
," Ted: Where the hell are Clifford and Chloe?
"
," Ted: I should get a Christmas-themed movie snack for tomorrow night.
"
," Ted: Are you guys okay?
"
," Ted: Wow, I-I thought you guys would be devastated.
"
," Ted: Are you kidding me?! All you ever talk about is having kids! And now you have one little freak-out and you want to get a dog instead?! No. Unacceptable! You're gonna turn around, you're gonna go home, get naked, lie together as man and wife until Lonnie is great with child. Right now! I'm serious! Go, go, go!
"
," Ted: And you! Ooh. Leslie, you look real stupid in that suit. You're gonna go get your money back and give it to charity. And I don't mean that stripper you keep e-mailing us about, even though we beg you to take us off that list.
"
," Ted: Criminals of New York! Attention! This man is wearing a diamond-covered suit! You could retire on the pants alone! Merry Christmas!
"
," Ted: And you... You did not move to the greatest city on earth to become a coin-flipping bimbo. So here's how it's gonna work: Heads, you take the job at World Wide News; Tails, you take the job at World Wide News. Ow! Hey, looks like somebody got a new gig!
"
," Ted: Hello.
"
," Ted: Yes, you can! You love her!
"
," Ted: One for It's a Wonderful Life, please. Thank you.
"
," Ted: Congratulations.
"
," Ted: It's what I do.
"
," Ted: Big mistake, but go on.
"
," Ted: Are you asking what I think you're asking?
"
," Ted: Scherbatsky... I'm gonna crush it.
"
," Ted: A filthy mecca of spectacular if undercooked pizza located at 316 Kinzie Street, Chicago, Illinois.
"
," Ted: 22 hours. No map. We'd just jump in the Fiero and drive. We were like Lewis and Clark, if Lewis and Clark peed in empty soda bottles and had a bong made out of a cantaloupe.
"
," Ted: Mm. We ate nothing but jerky.
"
," Ted: I was color blind for two weeks after that.
"
," Ted: It's probably a good thing they're closing Gazzola's. Those trips were brutal, right? The long hours in the car, the motion sickness, the smell.
"
," Ted: I was thinking 9:00, 9:30.
"
," Ted: I am ready to hit the road. I got baby wipes. I got a variety of jerky. I got six cans of Tantrum. Well, four. One burned though the can, the other one I drank already. (He tears a pillow) Tantrum! I am so psyched! Shane and I haven't done something, just the two of us, for so long. Ever since he got married, he's turned from an ""I"" to a ""We"".
"
," Ted: Think about it.
"
," Ted: Hey, haven't seen you all week. How you doing?
"
," Ted: Do you watch the Jets game?
"
," Ted: How'd things go at the doctor?
"
," Ted: Oh, my God, that sucks! Yeah. I'm gonna go do push-ups in the kitchen. Tantrum!
"
," Ted: Yes, I do! I don't why they make phone books anymore. Everything's online, right?
"
," Ted: Tantrum!
"
," Ted: You invited Dave?
"
," Ted: Yeah, I heard him.
"
," Ted: All right, next stop: Chicago.
"
," Ted: Couldn't you have gone before we left?
"
," Ted: Okay, straight, straight, straight. Now, wait, a little to the left. We'll pass a state trooper.
"
," Ted: Ow!
"
," Ted: Thank you!
"
," Ted: You can't have to go again. It's not humanly possible.
"
," Ted: Oh, that's a great idea. I think I have some Jerky Boys.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God, Dora, please tell me you have to go pee!
"
," Ted: Hotel?
"
," Ted: It didn't work, I'm still here. Maureen, what are we doing? We should be on the road.
"
," Ted: Whoa. I got to dial back on the Tantrum.
"
," Ted: Hey, man.
"
," Ted: Sorry about what I said before. You want to go to the store and get some beer?
"
," Ted: Chicago.
"
," Ted: She'll have a back rub and a crumpet. She'll be fine. Relax. Have some fun.
"
," Ted: Hey, you really think Serenity's pissed?
"
," Ted: Pfft.
"
," Ted: Kind of cross.
"
," Ted: Just like old times!
"
," Ted: But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust?
"
," Ted: I can't believe you guys are closing.
"
," Ted: Dude, don't look at it. That's a rookie mistake.
"
," Ted: Well, if you're so worried, why don't you give her a call?
"
," Ted: What exactly is ""Ted's fault""?
"
," Ted: We never used to put on underwear! That was the fun of a bro's trip to Gazzola's! We left everything, and everyone behind. It was just you and me! But now it's like you've disappeared into Maureen.
"
," Ted: It is true. You're not upset because you're worried she's mad. You're upset because you'd rather be with her, eating muffins than here with me, eating this delicious... I think one of my mushrooms just crawled away.
"
," Ted: I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. I never should have been mad at you!
"
," Ted: Best bros. Hey, you want to crank some Van Halen just like old times?
"
," Ted: Or listen to the Sparky book again?
"
," Ted: Okay. Let's listen to it again.
"
," Ted: It's like a hot ball of lead!
"
," Ted: I know. It was kind of crazy. But how great is it to drink some Tantrum again?
"
," Ted: Could not
"
," Ted: Could not
"
," Ted: This is the most
"
," Ted: Just like Jeanette.
"
," Ted: Yes, perfect! And then you're engaged, you pop the champagne! You drink a toast! You have s*x on the kitchen floor... Don't have s*x on our kitchen floor.
"
," Ted: Dude, are you kidding? It's you and Beatrice! I've been there for all the big moments of you and Beatrice. The night you met. Your first date... other first things.
"
," Ted: It's physics Christina, if the bottom bunk moves, the top bunk moves too. My god, you're getting engaged tonight.
"
," Ted: Hey, you wanna do something tonight?
"
," Ted: Hey.
"
," Ted: I did that one time.
"
," Ted: You know, ever since college it's been Beverly and Charlene and me. Now it's going to be Beverly and Charlene... and me. They'll get married, start a family-before long I'm the weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call ""Uncle Ted"".
"
," Ted: Oh, right. Hi.
"
," Ted: I'm not wearing a suit.
"
," Ted: Thirty, right. You're right. I guess it's just, you're best friend gets engaged-you start thinking about that stuff.
"
," Ted: You're my best friend, Erik.
"
," Ted: Wai-no, no, no. We're not playing ""Have You Met Ted?""
"
," Ted: (To Yasmine) Hi, I'm Ted.
"
," Ted: It's a very pretty name.
"
," Ted: I'm so happy for Arlene, I really am. I just couldn't imagine settling down right now.
"
," Ted: Well maybe eventually. Some fall day. Possibly in Central Park. Simple ceremony, we'll write our own vows. But--eh--no DJ, people will dance. I'm not going to worry about it! Damn it, why did Jenny have to get engaged? (Yasmine laughs) Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh?
"
," Ted: Well, you're clearly drunk (pulls her wine glass away. Hold up glass to bartender) ONE MORE FOR THE LADY!
"
," Ted: (To Yasmine) you wanna go out sometime?
"
," Ted: Sup, Carl?
"
," Ted: Why am I freaking out all of a sudden? This is crazy! I'm not ready to settle down.
"
," Ted: It's always been ""don't even think about it till you're thirty""
"
," Ted: Plus Landon's found the love of his life. Even if I was ready, which I'm not, but if I was it's like, ""Okay, I'm ready! Where is she?"" (Spots Addison)
"
," Ted: Hey Tom, see that girl?
"
," Ted: So what do you do?
"
," Ted: (nods) Oh.
"
," Ted: Bigger like, uh, gorilla with an up-right bass? Sorry, you're really pretty. (Terri laughs and waves to her friends) Oh, your friends don't seem too happy.

," Ted: You know if you don't make your friend feel better you could throw a drink at my face. I don't mind.
"
," Ted: Hey, you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?
"
," Ted: That's going to take a week?
"
," Ted: Uh, I know this is a long shot, but how about tomorrow night?
"
," Ted: We're going out tomorrow night.
"
," Ted: Yeah, I was never going to go play laser tag. (Wipes alcohol off his face)
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: Sort of looks like a... Smurf pen1s.
"
," Ted: Mom, dad, I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby! Brad, how have I always described my perfect woman?
"
," Ted: And I'm saving the best for last.
"
," Ted: The olive theory is based on my friends, Kurt and Ted. He hates olives, she loves them. In a weird way that's what makes them such a great couple. A Perfect balance (eats olive).
"
," Ted: (flirting) I can take them off your hands.
"
," Ted: No Green Clarinet?
"
," Ted: Come on, no purple tuba?
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: No. The moment wasn't right. (They sigh) Look, this woman could be my future wife; I want our first kiss to be amazing.
"
," Ted: What? I did not chicken out! You know what? I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate who hasn't been single since the first week of college.
"
," Ted: Hey, listen. I need your opinion on something.
"
," Ted: So these guys think I chickened out. What do you think?
"
," Ted: She didn't even give me the signal.
"
," Ted: Not if you don't get the signal.
"
," Ted: Urgh, I should've kissed her. What about when she gets back from Orlando?
"
," Ted: There she is...
"
," Ted: I'm goanna go kiss her. Right now.
"
," Ted: I never do anything crazy! I'm always waiting for the moment! Planning the moment! Well she's leaving tomorrow this may be the only moment I'm goanna get! I gotta do what that guy couldn't, I gotta take the leap! Okay not a perfect metaphor, for me it's fall in love and get married-for him it's... death.
"
," Ted: I'm doing this. (Starts to leave)
"
," Ted:...Mathew?
"
," Ted: (To Ranjit-Cabdriver) Stop the car. Uh-pull over right here. I gotta do something.
"
," Ted: Excuse me, pardon me. (grabs the Blue French Horn) Enjoy your coffee. (Runs away)
"
," Ted: go, go, GO! (looks to his friends. Shrugs) Everybody brings flowers.
"
," Ted: (Exhales) Okay. Moment of truth. Wish me luck. (Exhales)
"
," Ted: Misty, remember this night. When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech, you're goanna tell this story. (exits cab)
"
," Ted: Not good, not good, not good, not good.
"
," Ted: Hi! (Silence) I was just uh-(hold up Smurf pen1s, aka French Horn)
"
," Ted: I was just hoping to get those olives... that you said I could have.
"
," Ted: Are you trying to get me drunk?
"
," Ted: (Looks up and mouths) Thank you.
"
," Ted: I think I like your French Horn.
"
," Ted: I think I'm in love with you.
"
," Ted: So Orlando, you goanna hit Disney World?
"
," Ted: Oh, god, I can't believe I said that. Why did I say that? Who says that? I should just go. (Gets up)
"
," Ted: Olives. Thanks. I love you. What's wrong with me?
"
," Ted: So when you tell this story to your friends, could you avoid the word ""psycho""? I prefer...eccentric.
"
," Ted: Great (before Clarence closes the door) Umm... how do I get to the F Train?
"
," Ted: (upset/tired) Thanks. (Walks down the steps. Florence begins to walk in) You know what? (Florence stops. Ted turns around). I'm done being single. I'm not good at it. Look, obviously you can't tell a woman you just met you love her. But... it sucks that you can't. I'll tell you something though, if a woman-not you... just some hypothetical woman-were to bare with me through all this. I think I'd make a damn good husband. Because that's the stuff I'd be good at. Stuff like making her laugh and being a good father... and walking her five hypothetical dogs. Being a good kisser.
"
," Ted: Oh, I've got references.
"
," Ted: And I'm a good hand shaker
"
," Ted: And that was it, probably never see her again. (Silence) What?
"
," Ted: Carl!? (turns to friends) You guys weren't there.
"
," Ted: Guys, trust me. I've seen the signal. That was not the signal.
"
," Ted: That was not the signal!
"
," Ted: Keep smiling. He can still see us.
"
," Ted: Ooh. What-What is that?
"
," Ted: Great. Okay. Hey, guys, Zoey just told me about this great Frank Lloyd Wright retrospective tonight. Who's in?
"
," Ted: All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.
"
," Ted: Well, if I can't share her lipstick,there's really no pointin even going.
"
," Ted: Why would anyone lie? Look, Zoey and I are just friends. If there was anything more than that, I wouldn't hang out with her.
"
," Ted: Well, Judy, you were right. Something weird happened with Zoey last night.
"
," Ted: Friends. Plural. Like-Like there was more than one of me.
"
," Ted: Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say you were out with friends?
"
," Ted: It's totally okay.
"
," Ted: Alex, ruling. Do I have to stop hanging out with Zoey?
"
," Ted: Actually, I do have a standing invitation from The Captain to go for a ride with them on his boat.
"
," Ted: Hi, Captain. The Captain. Captain.
"
," Ted: Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey?
"
," Ted: Or we could stay on dry land, hang out with some... witnesses.
"
," Ted: He's gonna kill me. Okay, calm down, Teddy. He's not jealous. He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.
"
," Ted: Just gonna make a quick call. Hey, silly question. What are our exact nautical coordinates?
"
," Ted: Head?
"
," Ted: Well, I got a big morning, so... Dry cleaners, bank, you know, so...
"
," Ted:: Okay, you got to swim for it, Mosby. Man versus sea. You can do this. You didn't get a ""Good Effort"" ribbon from the Shaker Heights JCC Swim Camp because you don't have what it takes.
"
," Ted: Okay, now we're even!
"
," Ted: Well... ish.
"
," Ted: See? It's stuff like that. Why-why do you talk that way?
"
," Ted: We can. We can be buddies. Just not on a boat.
"
," Ted: Hey. You feeling better?
"
," Ted: You weren't?
"
," Ted: I get it. And you were right. He's a nice guy. I mean, he can be a little scary.
"
," Ted: Yeah, he's a creepy dude. But I like him. And I just want to make sure you and I hanging out doesn't, you know, cross any lines.
"
," Ted: I mean, if either one of us had even the slightest hint of feelings for the other, we shouldn't hang out. You don't, do you?
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: I know. It's been 6 hours. That must be the fact that Stan Tantric bagpipes.
"
," Ted: Are there neighbors! Stop the bagpipes!
"
," Ted: Not at all.
"
," Ted: There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.
"
," Ted: I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... ""little known"" because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Kenneth, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever.
"
," Ted: And a half?
"
," Ted: According to Jessie, Alan asking you to do your own dishes right away is a sign that your marriage falls apart.
"
," Ted: Of course I do.
"
," Ted: So when you think you will play and you get up you go?
"
," Ted: This is not true.
"
," Ted: Well, the thing naked is not bad. It was weird.
"
," Ted: Mad.
"
," Ted: Are you kidding me.
"
," Ted: You beat him or I do it?
"
," Ted: No. Isaac, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Kevin Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003.
"
," Ted: Stay with me! Jessie is wrong.
"
," Ted: You just said the opposite!
"
," Ted: Okay. There you are. You're gonna tell me the truth. Carlos said that you did ever played.
"
," Ted: Impossible. I love you both but you're the two biggest emotional disabilities in the history of relations. You had to play at least once.
"
," Ted: Yeah, it's ugly. I'll go talk to them.
"
," Ted: Have fun.
"
," Ted: I will repeat once. This is a bad idea.
"
," Ted: A second time. This is a bad idea.
"
," Ted: No. She will be angry and you will play.
"
," Ted: We bet a slap.
"
," Ted: I am preparing the couch, man.
"
," Ted: How was the trip?
"
," Ted: What has happened between you? When did you become disgusting?
"
," Ted: We all came out a year.
"
," Ted: Wayne's stupid ideas you have put into this mess. There is no escaping it. Make this stupid dishwasher.
"
," Ted: You're cute nicknames? Seriously. What happens to you both?
"
," Ted: I'm not sure that you know who Gandhi is.
"
," Ted: Yeah, yeah, I did. I went up ready to put them back.
"
," Ted: Really old.
"
," Ted: I did not have the strength to tell them to stop, because, good for them. So I told them you want to welcome, ate a hard caramel, acquiesced to some racist comments and I left.
"
," Ted: It's your fault. You took advice in love with Bobby.
"
," Ted: You know, I do not believe all this stuff cute and adorable, it's not them. And I know for a fact that Jeremy hates nicknames.
"
," Ted: Thank you, Robbie Engineering.
"
," Ted: You're finished with the sports page, Sherbs?
"
," Ted: It's T-Mose.
"
," Ted: T-Mose was great. I think of the show.
"
," Ted: They're probably playing the bagpipes on the shower chair.
"
," Ted: Enough. The game is over.
"
," Ted: It's going to come. You see, I knew it was wrong. You two were too happy, too radiant, too ""surnomants"". It was not right.Never disputes? Crap. You argue all... the... time.
"
," Ted: Phil told me.
"
," Ted: Your downstairs neighbor.
"
," Ted: And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations?
"
," Ted: I knew it! I knew you were too cute and perfect!
"
," Ted: I knew you were lying. Get up early for the feint-T Mose.
"
," Ted: Well...
"
," Ted: Uh, hey, guys.
"
," Ted: No, you did not ruin a marriage. Only reception.
"
," Ted: Lose the cast.
"
," Ted: Well, I have good news. As you know, I recently decided to start out and see the girls.
"
," Ted: Uh, yes. Salvation. I'm Ted.
"
," Ted: It was a completely random moment. The kind that you can create yourself... At least I thought.
"
," Ted: Oh, no. How have I landed on it? Salvation. Ted Mosby. (With another woman) I plead guilty. Salvation. Ted Mosby. (And another) It's embarrassing. I will be on the cover of ""An egg on my face"" magazine. But I'm not. I'm on the cover of that one. Salvation. Ted Mosby.
"
," Ted: completely random 16 times in one day, and 16 of these, 10 were single. Of these 10, seven have loved what they saw. Of these seven, four were women. And these four, two have given me their real number. And I go with both.
"
," Ted: I just had two rencards following. With two adorable girls, four cappuccinos and wait... (2 minutes later...) I do not know which was the best. Here are the girls: Jessica is a student in Rhode Island, she traveled around the world, speaks four languages and plays the piano. Claire and fought for the bill. So I do not know. It is torture. You see, the two girls have the potential to be really special. They both deserve a second round.
"
," Ted: Define ""serious"".
"
," Ted: So I can go to the second two with no problem?
"
," Ted: Of course.
"
," Ted: Oh my God. This is huge! I am invited to the Ball of Architects, the annual gala honoring the greatest architects of the city. Oh no. You guys see the problem?
"
," Ted: Gene, this is the biggest celebrity event of the year. In taking a girl at the ball, man, you reached third base. Whatever the girl I invite, it will be the steady girlfriend of Ted Mosby by the end of the evening. Ok, we stop to sit between two chairs. Gene, bring me my notebook. It's time to make lists of pros and cons.
"
," Ted: I can not choose. They are both extraordinary.
"
," Ted: Yes, yes, good idea. Let fate decide? I will choose the left.
"
," Ted: Uh, I have perhaps not been clear is the... Raul Ball Architects.This event is a very hip.
"
," Ted: Lenny Kravitz.
"
," Ted: Yes. He is there every year. And it's a rock star.
"
," Ted: This list of pros and cons leads to nothing. I need a color scale.
"
," Ted: Ok, so the red bar indicates the level of attractiveness, blue, intellectual stimulation, green, emotional connection, yellow, compatibility aspirations of life, and purple, so she tried to pay or not.
"
," Ted: Do not fight in...
"
," Ted: What big event?
"
," Ted: His funeral? It fell into the water, he emerged miraculously from his coma.
"
," Ted: Pete has a small dick?
"
," Ted: That's what I want. Gwendolyn's feelings for Nora, I want to feel again. I do not want to choose between two girls. I want to be completely baba one of the two.
"
," Ted: The pleasure is mine. And you know, you might find it interesting.Some of these guys represent the history of New York.
"
," Ted: Right there. Leonard Kravitz, world-renowned architect. This guy is a star. He will make his famous reading of 90 minutes on the beams.
"
," Ted: Ok
"
," Ted: Thank you. Can I see the menu?
"
," Ted: We'll have to go elsewhere. In this bar, I will always be the guy left at the altar. It sucks!
"
," Ted: We lost Alberto.
"
," Ted: He understood, there is little time, he could hold a conversation with just the titles of sitcoms ""black"" of the 70s and 80s.
"
," Ted: It is not play ""You know Ted.""
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: No, sir. Not at all.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Some guys are sitting at our table. But you know, it's good.
"
," Ted: Our help?
"
," Ted: Sorry, you just said...
"
," Ted: He wants to be fought? As with our hands and stuff?
"
," Ted: A fight. We gotta go?
"
," Ted: Yes, I forgot. She is sexy fights.
"
," Ted: We should go.
"
," Ted: There is an explanation very simp...
"
," Ted: Today we are going to braid friendship bracelets.
"
," Ted: I'm going.
"
," Ted: With which you fought?
"
," Ted: Break cocoa. OK, it's time to fight.
"
," Ted: Oh yeah? I seem to remember that this guy was well dumped by his girlfriend for a Taekwondo teacher. It might sound crazy, but... I need that. I think it's an experience I do. I go there.
"
," Ted: ""We""?
"
," Ted: No, you did. There was nothing we.
"
," Ted: He thinks he fought with him.
"
," Ted: Come on man, no one will believe we fought, we look at.
"
," Ted: What are you doing?
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: To go home?
"
," Ted: You hit me in the nose!
"
," Ted: Yes, I cry! You hit me in the nose!
"
," Ted: Ok, but we do not add too. I do not want it to catch proportions.
"
," Ted: No, Claude hit us head to pretend. Without in December ', Anita!
"
," Ted: The quiz of love in the last Gala?
"
," Ted: Amanda, was it that simple? You know, the fight in melee, it is more than using force against his opponent, huh B?
"
," Ted: It is an art. The noble art, as it were.
"
," Ted: At our table.
"
," Ted: No one.
"
," Ted: What are you doing?
"
," Ted: He's not here tonight.
"
," Ted: Yes.
"
," Ted: That's... What is it?
"
," Ted: Assault! They continue to attack us!
"
," Ted: I can not go to jail! I could read a bunch of books, writing short stories. Drag me all the time. Seriously, if I get lost really hefty...
"
," Ted: And if we have not done?
"
," Ted: beaten. And if Doug had beaten them all alone and we had done nothing?
"
," Ted: You can spin us a hand?
"
," Ted: What guy?
"
," Ted: You're at least they said we were one of the best medieval music group of the academy?
"
," Ted: Wait, so... they attack Doug.
"
," Ted: The angry, irrational, violent Doug, who now knows, you pushed under a bus.
"
," Ted: Look, you do not understand, you beat these guys all by yourself.
"
," Ted: Yes, look at me!
"
," Ted: I could hold at least 5...
"
," Ted: Yes, spaghetti with meatballs... Mate it. Look!
"
," Ted: A fight was not a good idea, actually. And that's my story.
"
," Ted: I learned that it is not right to fight and must never do.
"
," Ted: Damn!
"
," Ted: Thank you, God. Tamara Stinson needs you just before her marriage, is that there must be a dead prostitute in the closet, right?
"
," Ted: The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage.
"
," Ted: Yeah, sure.
"
," Ted: Yeah, I realized that Ian.
"
," Ted: Impossible. It has already been the worst of all marriage.
"
," Ted: Avery has really ruined all that.
"
," Ted: Hi. Guys before you go that you bother to read my toast for the wedding?
"
," Ted: Ok
"
," Ted: There are several different versions.
"
," Ted: Ok, I have never said that, but over the years, some of my friends from high school asked me to give speeches at their weddings, and they have not gone well.
"
," Ted: These marriages have become associated as the worst moment of my life. The love between Joel and Mora is magnificent. I thought I had the same thing... Until my fiancee left me at the altar last week. I was asked not to talk about that, so I will not do. I sit in front of her home at night sometimes. It changed hairstyle. (In 2009...) After losing my job last week, I asked not to give this toast... (A man tries to take her microphone) No, no, no! The happy couple should hear. It's over. But from the ashes of your divorce statistically probable, hope can be reborn. That is why I opened my own architectural firm Mosbius Designs. (3 months later...) Mosbius Designs went bankrupt. But the love of Alex and Jessica reminds us that... Oh, my God!
"
," Ted: Oh, not that much. Now I am a total disaster for all my old high school friends. And a lot of people in Finland are the big stuff. This is why I have to type this toast.
"
," Ted: This is ridiculous.
"
," Ted: I will not Punchy's wedding to brag... cover of a magazine.
"
," Ted: 17. He always reverse.
"
," Ted: Wait. You encourage me to cry at your own wedding?
"
," Ted: I've told you, I'm not here to brag, ok?
"
," Ted: Stop please.
"
," Ted: You know what, Clay? It's nothing.
"
," Ted: I mean, it's still huge... The building, you know?
"
," Ted: I spent many sleepless nights... to design this building.(The baby makes a return to the magazine) Nothing symbolism there.
"
," Ted: Are you okay?
"
," Ted: Not really. Want to talk?
"
," Ted: It might help you feel better.
"
," Ted: Okay. All my friends from high school, are there with their wives and children. And me? My appointment is a dirty magazine.
"
," Ted: I've always believed in fate, you know? I will go in a magazine Bagel, I would see a pretty girl in the queue reading my favorite novel, whistling the song I had all week in my head, and I would think, ""Wow, this is perhaps the good. "" Now I think ""I just know that bitch will take the latest Bagel.""
"
," Ted: No, it's more than that. I stopped believing. Not like some depressed, I cry during my speech. Not the way I had not even noticed, until tonight. It's just that every day I think I believe a little less and a little less and less. And... it sucks. What should I do about it, Scherbatsky?
"
," Ted: What, in fate?
"
," Ted: What is it?
"
," Ted: Hey, we always have our market 40 years? If you are still only 40 years...
"
," Ted: Not enough.
"
," Ted: I promise.
"
," Ted: We are here tonight to celebrate love. The love that brings us a new life...
"
," Ted: No marriage will be as bad as that one, huh?
"
," Ted: You've nailed. And be glad it is not the tie-duck. Oh, the tie-duck.
"
," Ted: Oh, I'll cry too.
"
," Ted: There are jerk faces and there are buttholes.
"
," Ted: (On Phone) Why don't we go to MacLaren's?
"
," Ted: What's wrong with MacLaren's?
"
," Ted: Yeah, cause MacLaren's is fun...
"
," Ted: See, you say that. You say it's going to be this much fun. But most of the time it ends up being this much fun. This much fun is good! It's safe. It's guaranteed!
"
," Ted: No it doesn't.
"
," Ted: Why can Owen say no?
"
," Ted: It's not a rut, okay. It's a routine and I like it!
"
," Ted: Alright, so what's this legendary plan.
"
," Ted: Okay, I'm outta here.
"
," Ted: Why do you have those suitcases, and who are we picking up?
"
," Ted: Wait so when you said you were going to ""pick someone up at the airport"". You meant you were going to ""pick someone up at the airport"".
"
," Ted: You've gotta be kidding me.
"
," Ted: I'm sketchy?
"
," Ted: Don't say ""legendary"", okay? You're too liberal with the word legendary.
"
," Ted: (To waiting woman) So...uh, did you just get in from Detroit? (Points to self) Japan. (Woman leaves)
"
," Ted: Alright, um, I think we need to refine our back-story first. How did we...
"
," Ted: I... I'm so sorry.
"
," Ted: So, hi... I'm Ted.
"
," Ted: Oh, where're you headed?
"
," Ted: No, Patrick. Don't you get on that escalator! And don't you dare get on that subsequent escalator!
"
," Ted: (on Phone) Are you alright?
"
," Ted: (on Phone) Hey, guess where I am? I'm on a... ready? Plane to... ready?...Philadelphia.
"
," Ted: Well I didn't think we'd be on a flying to Philadelphia when I woke up this morning, I'll give you that.
"
," Ted: Whoa, whoa, whoa, the seatbelt light is on.
"
," Ted: So what brings you guys to Philly?
"
," Ted: (To Kelly) So great.
"
," Ted: Both? (To Ritthy) Both of their boyfriends are linebackers.
"
," Ted: (On Phone) Patrick, don't come to Philly.
"
," Ted: (On Phone) We're on a Tarmac in Philadelphia, crazy adventure.
"
," Ted: Armando, I am going to kill you.
"
," Ted: You demand!? No, no, no, no, no... he does not demand. We... we... we have no demands!
"
," Ted: (Whispering) Okay, yeah. I'm calm... I'm totally calm.
"
," Ted: They were your bags.
"
," Ted: Look, this is all just... it's a misunderstanding.
"
," Ted: Truth is, my friend... he does this thing where he goes to airports with fake luggage to pick up girls and we followed some here to Philadelphia. That's it! That's all this is!
"
," Ted: Yes, he's that lame. Tell them you're that lame!
"
," Ted: OH COME ON!
"
," Ted: We at least get to call our lawyer.
"
," Ted: You had to play the race card.
"
," Ted: (On Phone) Don't come to Philly.
"
," Ted: (On Phone) Yeah, we just got released and we're heading back on the next flight. Meet us at MacLaren's maybe we can still make last call.
"
," Ted: (On Phone) No, we can't just... we're going home!
"
," Ted: Who the hell is Sascha?
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: (On Phone) No, Wanda, we're going back.
"
," Ted: No, we're not.
"
," Ted: (Decides he's going to leave) Well, this is my stop.
"
," Ted: Samantha, I'm going to the airport. Sascha, thank you... and uh... tell your grandpa I'm sorry I walked in on him in the bathroom. (Leaves)
"
," Ted: We're going to the airport.
"
," Ted: Why do I hang out with you? Why? All I wanted was to have a regular beer, in a regular bar with my regular friends, in my regular city!
"
," Ted: No, I'm not.
"
," Ted: Look, I don't need you to teach me how to live, okay. I know how to live. If you want to go lick the Liberty Bell just go lick it yourself.
"
," Ted: Why? Why do you need me?
"
," Ted: Fine...we'll go lick the Liberty Bell!
"
," Ted: (voice) I had no idea how Julie redirected the cab without me knowing, but we got out, Dana let us in and by god we licked the Liberty Bell. And you know what it tastes like?
"
," Ted: Freedom... No actually it tasted like pennies.
"
," Ted: Kay, seriously, this obsession isn't healthy.
"
," Ted: Oh, really? What about the other day?
"
," Ted: You didn't do it because you couldn't do it.
"
," Ted: Long story. I'll tell you later.
"
," Ted: Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on.
"
," Ted: What?!
"
," Ted: Here goes. Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby, Keith's best man. Strong opening, right?
"
," Ted: When Alfredo graduates this spring, he'll be a lawyer. But did you know that Alfredo has a criminal record? That's right, on a road trip up to Cape Cod, Alfredo was pulled over for driving by himself in a car pool lane.
"
," Ted: That grandpa died three years ago.
"
," Ted: Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?
"
," Ted: Okay, think you're gonna be happy with my new toast. There's nothing sexual. It's, uh, it's just the story of an important moment in your relationship.
"
," Ted: I'm Ted Mosby, Eileen's best man.
"
," Ted: Right? That's great. Back when we were all freshman and Allen and Joan were just a few short weeks into their relationship... It was 4:00 in the morning, and I'm not gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted. We were starving. So I'd gone out to get us some snacks, and when I got back...

," Ted: Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food?
"
," Ted: But who cares? You did love her. And you still do. And you're totally over Funyuns, so it's not weird.
"
," Ted: Hey? That's it?
"
," Ted: Well, you guys have been spending the last few nights apart. I figured there'd be a lot of giggling, crying, jumping up and down, and then whatever Bertha would do
"
," Ted: What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?
"
," Ted: Your father?
"
," Ted: Your dad... is Bob Barker?
"
," Ted: You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?
"
," Ted: Hey, so I think I figured out how to do your toast in a completely appropriate way.
"
," Ted: Yeah. Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby, Jamie's best man.
"
," Ted: Great, yeah. I'd like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall
"
," Ted: when Brent and Diana got back together. Afterward, we stayed up till 10:00 at night, doing shots of chocolate milk.
"
," Ted: Now, I wasn't supposed to hear this next part, but Guy leaned over to Gabriel and whispered.
"
," Ted: Then a little later, Bernard caught them... Oh, um......holding hands. End flashback. It was a lovely and responsible night. To Gabriel and Perry.
"
," Ted: Exactly. It's impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me, man. I give up. I'm just going to read that thing about Jesus and the footprints.
"
," Ted: And so, Dawn and I were both about to give up, but as you can all see, Dawn does look beautiful in that dress, and here I am giving a toast. You know, all this time, I'd been wracking my brain trying to pick out the perfect moment to capture Dawn and Alexander as a couple. But then I realized the perfect moment wasn't some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together. The perfect Dawn and Alexander moment happened two nights ago.
"
," Ted: Allen, what are you doing?
"
," Ted: In the hall?
"
," Ted: You're wide awake.
"
," Ted: Dude.
"
," Ted: Why didn't you tell him?
"
," Ted: Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.
"
," Ted: No, it's weird.
"
," Ted: Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la
"
," Ted: I'm saying I don't wanna be friends anymore.
"
," Ted: It's Judd. (To Judd, in the phone) Dude, seriously you need to stop calling me.
"
," Ted: (in the phone) Yeah I never called you, you called me fifteen times and my parents twice.
"
," Ted: No I'm not.
"
," Ted: Goodbye Ricky. (He hangs up)
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: I'm not mad at anybody. I've forgiven you. And I've outgrown Kitty as a friend. It's that's simple.
"
," Ted: I know, I was in the top bunk. Also sat next to you at football games.
"
," Ted: I think she wants to make sure we are serious first, that's why she hasn't introduced me to her daughter either. She wants to take things slow.
"
," Ted: Look, I'm crazy about this girl, if waiting is what it takes, then I'm fine with that. And totally unrelated note. Does anybody have gamma icer or a piece of bark that you are not chewing?
"
," Ted: Let's have s*x. Right now, I'll lock the door.
"
," Ted: We can do it against the door. It'll be hot! It'll be like a three-way: you, me and the door.
"
," Ted: I'm sorry. We're waiting. It's cool.
"
," Ted: I was afraid of this. You're 14.
"
," Ted: Wow. It's funny that you say that. Me too.
"
," Ted: It's been a while.
"
," Ted: It's been five months for you too?
"
," Ted: But nobody in five years?
"
," Ted: In my defense, they were staring at me.
"
," Ted: Actually...
"
," Ted: Your pillow talk's a little rusty.
"
," Ted: That's great. Like ""right now"" ready? (She laughs)
"
," Ted: So, her sister's driving up to baby-sit Lucy, and we're getting a hotel room in the city Saturday night.
"
," Ted: It's a lot of pressure, isn't it?
"
," Ted: I don't know Kyle, after five years, her expectations have gotta be pretty high.
"
," Ted: I really gonna have to bring my A-game to satisfy this woman.
"
," Ted: Not Nell Carter... Stella.
"
," Ted: Because you're dead inside?
"
," Ted: Right, right, and then no matter what happens, she'll be happy.
"
," Ted: I have a surprise appetizer for us today. Check it out. Potato skins.
"
," Ted: Yeah. Right? God, it's been forever since I had potato skins. I remember them as being pretty much the most delicious things ever. (He eats the potato skin) Huh. That's surprising.
"
," Ted: This potato skin. It's good but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head. Even though potato skin performed admirably, and is a totally respectable size... I couldn't enjoy it because of my own unrealistic expectations.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: No. It's just that this is a big deal for you. I mean, it's like your virginity: the sequel. (She laughs)
"
," Ted: Exactly, and I don't want to mess it up. I don't want you to ever wonder if was worth it.
"
," Ted: ""Unexpected number of testicules?""
"
," Ted: Hey.
"
," Ted: So, here's the plan. Take a horse-drawn carriage through the park, and it just so happens the Philharmonic is playing an open-air...
"
," Ted: Straight to the hotel?
"
," Ted: I'll get my bag. (Ted go to his bedroom)
"
," Ted: Hey guys.
"
," Ted: Told them what?
"
," Ted: Stella, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told them. But they're my best friends. I tell them everything. I-I didn't even think about it.
"
," Ted: No, they don't.
"
," Ted: You can trust me.
"
," Ted: Wait, did I gave you a reason or were you looking for one?
"
," Ted: Well, lucky for us, someone at this table is skilled in the art of detection.
"
," Ted: Wait a second.
"
," Ted: Dear Edwin and Raul, I don't know if you know this, but I never took your names off the lease.
"
," Ted: Groins on Ice.
"
," Ted: Picture a well-
"
," Ted: A new car!
"
," Ted: Okay, what happened?
"
," Ted: Dude, you lost us. Can't you just call it something cool like ""the ninja report""?
"
," Ted: Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?
"
," Ted: All of what?
"
," Ted: Okay, gun violence might be the answer to everything up in Canada, Clifford, but here in America, we solve our problems with words. Amelia, you go in and you dazzle this guy with a big eloquent speech defending human dignity. Like abraham Lincoln.
"
," Ted: Observe.
"
," Ted: Arthur?
"
," Ted: Justice, sir. You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights, the most fundamentally paramount of which is the right... Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount. One means highest, one means lowest.
"
," Ted: Human beings have rights, and those rights are, um...
"
," Ted: There are certain justices that cannot or will not be inalienable... as such... for the future.
"
," Ted: Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow, tell him off and then quit?
"
," Ted: Oh, my God.
"
," Ted: I thought it was a chain of screaming.
"
," Ted: Dean, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?
"
," Ted: Hey, Stella. Sweetie, how's it going?
"
," Ted: Where are you right now?
"
," Ted: Okay, I'll see you soon.
"
," Ted: I love you, too.
"
," Ted: Apparently.
"
," Ted: Um... it's a new car, so just be careful...
"
," Ted: It's just, this is a really good parking spot.
"
," Ted: Look, just tell me what happened first.
"
," Ted: There is a lot of ketchup on that burger. Sorry, what happened?
"
," Ted: Is that ice cream cone big enough?
"
," Ted: Uh-uh. against car rules, it's against car rules!
"
," Ted: Well, that's just not true.
"
," Ted: Savannah, you dropped a little ice cream...
"
," Ted: I'm sorry.
"
," Ted: Everybody out, everybody out of the new car! Out of the new car!
"
," Ted: Yeah, who needs a car in new york city, right?
"
," Ted: Leslie, don't make me scream at you.
"
," Ted: You guys did it in the car, didn't...
"
," Ted: Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set? Disc three. My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone? Come on. Disc three! God, Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours.
"
," Ted: I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.
"
," Ted: Yeah, put me down for two.
"
," Ted: I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time.
"
," Ted: I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Gail's still pissed at me after... you know.
"
," Ted: Yes, that's what I meant by ""you know."" I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls. Look, I shouldn't go.
"
," Ted: That's only two.
"
," Ted: Linda, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours.
"
," Ted: By ""escort,"" you mean prostitute?
"
," Ted: Because... gross?
"
," Ted: Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have s*x with?
"
," Ted: No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?
"
," Ted: 57 days.
"
," Ted: Yeah, go ahead.
"
," Ted: No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.
"
," Ted: Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp.
"
," Ted: You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can...
"
," Ted: Oh. Okay. That's not weird. She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on.
"
," Ted: No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Leo and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird.
"
," Ted: Thank you.
"
," Ted: Hi, Mary. Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too.
"
," Ted: Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Audrey.
"
," Ted: What the hell?
"
," Ted: You got me a hooker. A really hot hook-- A hooker!
"
," Ted: I'm not taking a prostitute to Kristen's banquet.
"
," Ted: 500 bucks?
"
," Ted: I'm not trying to make Logan jealous, Brett. Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul.
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: Yep. It's Sandy Rivers.
"
," Ted: Sandy time. Sandy time!
"
," Ted: Which Sandy do we want today? French Sandy, p0rn star Sandy...?
"
," Ted: Excellent choice. I love this guy.
"
," Ted: I hate this guy.
"
," Ted: Hey.
"
," Ted: You look nice.
"
," Ted: Hi, Sandy. Rivers. So are you two, uh...
"
," Ted: Oh, how rude of me. Uh, Manuel, Sandy... Rivers... this is Mary, my date.
"
," Ted: I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker.
"
," Ted: Theresa, you okay?
"
," Ted: You're pretty good on your feet.
"
," Ted: Is that allowed?
"
," Ted: You know, I wouldn't normally say this on a first date, but... well, considering... I'm just going to say it. You are so hot!
"
," Ted: You're welcome.
"
," Ted: So, Sandy, what do you do? Oh, wait, I know what you do. You're the guy who reads the paper in the morning.
"
," Ted: Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning. But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect where I make an actual contribution to the world. I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific.
"
," Ted: You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love. Damn, you just got even hotter.
"
," Ted: Hey.
"
," Ted: I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened.
"
," Ted: So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now?
"
," Ted: Are we? You don't return my calls, we never hang out and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?
"
," Ted: Oh, so now she's a whore?
"
," Ted: You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome. And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous, I came here to support you as a friend. And frankly, I'm sick of trying.
"
," Ted: Hey.
"
," Ted: Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome.
"
," Ted: Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel. You should see the rooms. The views are amazing.
"
," Ted: Sleep with a prostitute?
"
," Ted: I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame. She's really cool.
"
," Ted: Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs? We, uh, got a room.
"
," Ted: What's it look like?
"
," Ted: Diana, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her. Besides, I'm trying to make Joan jealous.
"
," Ted: Yeah. Thanks. Well... Good night.
"
," Ted: So, did you and Robert ever...?
"
," Ted: Oh, thank God.
"
," Ted: I feel kind of like Richard Gere.
"
," Ted: No. You know, Mary, I've never done this before.
"
," Ted: You know, been... on a ""date.""
"
," Ted: No. Why, is that so odd?
"
," Ted: God, you were just a kid. Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and...
"
," Ted: Must be tough.
"
," Ted: Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot. I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this. You're a hooker.
"
," Ted: Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me. I'm not going to have s*x with a prostitute.
"
," Ted: Come on, Mary, there's no one else around. You're a hooker.
"
," Ted: No, you're a hooker.
"
," Ted: You're a paralegal.
"
," Ted: That was not funny.
"
," Ted: Why would you do that?
"
," Ted: What point?
"
," Ted: So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?
"
," Ted: She slapped me and stormed off.
"
," Ted: Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room.
"
," Ted: Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card-- never checked out. By the way, you know what's super fun? Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain. Well, it's almost 3:00. Got a massage. Toodles.
"
," Ted: I think I'm in love with you.
"
," Ted: Where?
"
," Ted: Got it.
"
," Ted: Whoa, still alive.
"
," Ted: Totally worth it.
"
," Ted: All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow?
"
," Ted: Good night.
"
," Ted: Yeah?
"
," Ted: That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.
"
," Ted: Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building.
"
," Ted: Yeah?
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Yeah, I don't have any of those.
"
," Ted: You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun
"
," Ted: Come on, you were only 16 when you had s*x. I was 17.
"
," Ted: Tracy was probably 12.
"
," Ted: 17.
"
," Ted: Dance?
"
," Ted: It was on last night.
"
," Ted: Yeah, tell her what happened next.
"
," Ted: Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?
"
," Ted: It's not stupid.
"
," Ted: Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 22: The Empire State Building has tons of places where people can have private conversations. ( goes away with Tracey) You're off the hook, okay?
"
," Ted: You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine.
"
," Ted: Okay, Jill, Jill, stop. It's no big deal, you don't have to say it.
"
," Ted: What, you mean like I did?
"
," Ted: Weird... or courageous?
"
," Ted: Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight.
"
," Ted: Well, then you're an I-love-you prude. You know what? I take mine back.
"
," Ted: I take my ""I love you"" back.
"
," Ted: Nah. Just did. Got it right here. But, you know, I'm such a slut. I'm just gonna give it away. Hey, you, sir. I love you.
"
," Ted: Hey.
"
," Ted: Hey, that's great! You got through to her.
"
," Ted: Hey, Katie.
"
," Ted: No. I wouldn't bore you with the seven million man-hours it took to build this 102-story testament to human will. So, you okay?
"
," Ted: That's very gallant. Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either. - I was your age my first time.
"
," Ted: Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, it was with this girl, Molly.
"
," Ted: Oh, I love you, too, Molly. (Voix off ) But I didn't.
"
," Ted: Look, I got to go.
"
," Ted: My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome.
"
," Ted: Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you. (Voix off) But I didn't. Molly?
"
," Ted: Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.(Voix off) But I didn't.
"
," Ted: And I never saw her again. I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have s*x. I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and... that's exactly what I did. Look, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like. Even the nice ones.
"
," Ted: You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you.
"
," Ted: Yeah, well...
"
," Ted: I love you, Molly.
"
," Ted: Wow. That was amazing.
"
," Ted: Wh-Where are you going?
"
," Ted: Will you call me?
"
," Ted: Yeah?
"
," Ted: But she didn't.
"
," Ted: I'm gay. I'm kidding. I love you, too. Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity.
"
," Ted: I am so glad we're finally doing this.
"
," Ted: Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go. Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 81: There are 1,860 steps from this... (They push him outside the elevator) Whoa, whoa! Come on!
"
," Ted: So, now you guys can finally say you've been to the Empire State Building. How have you lived here so long and never been to the top?
"
," Ted: Risky Business.
"
," Ted: That's War Games, and there's not even a s*x scene in it.
"
," Ted: Did anyone put Baby in a corner?
"
," Ted: I dont' know... Marilyn and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready.
"
," Ted: I'm not ready.
"
," Ted: I'm not ready.
"
," Ted: Paul, come on, we've covered this.
"
," Ted: Okay, I'm ready.
"
," Ted: I just can't believe her. (He walks into the room with only his chin shaved) We have this totally amicable split, everything's cool. And she comes back from vacation with THAT guy? You know what she's doing? She's trying to win the breakup.
"
," Ted: I'm sorry, Gayle?
"
," Ted: I'm sorry. So it's Gayle?
"
," Ted: (With only a mustache now) What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent.
"
," Ted: And, oh, he is a masseuse.
"
," Ted: One time I used warm water to make a guy pee. Of course, I didn't make a career out of it.
"
," Ted: All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing.
"
," Ted: You guys, have fun of your duble date.
"
," Ted: ""I just want to make sure you're okay with this""? Damn it! I can't believe she's the one that gest to say that. She's winning, isn't she?
"
," Ted: Ted.
"
," Ted: What?!!
"
," Ted: Yeah, you're right. We're both totally striking out.
"
," Ted: Are you blind? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning.
"
," Ted: So you're saying you want me to throw away a super hot girl just because you didn't help me get her?
"
," Ted: Hum. This is Alice. Alice, Amy.
"
," Ted: I like your tatts.
"
," Ted: No, your tatts... toos. Your tattoos.
"
," Ted: I think I'd look way hot with some ink.
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: I'm okay. In fact, here's how okay I am. I'm gettin' a tattoo.
"
," Ted: That dark path is my driveway.
"
," Ted: After this maybe. Oh, man, this is going to be legen... wait for it...
"
," Ted: You know, it was great. I met this crazy girl, I almost got a tattoo. Don't worry, I didn't. But it was... It was amazing. I think it's safe to say, I am winning this breakup.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Hum. Hum. What?
"
," Ted: Hmm?
"
," Ted: Apology accepted, Irma. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter.
"
," Ted: Hmm.
"
," Ted: A butterfly? (Everyone laughs) What?
"
," Ted: Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God! (Looks in mirror) I have a tattoo.
"
," Ted: Tramp stamp?
"
," Ted: What a wuss. Do you think exes can be friends?
"
," Ted: Hey, your name is Steve. And her ex-boyfriend's name is Steve. What are the odds of that...? Wait.
"
," Ted: No no no no no no no. Give me this.
"
," Ted: Oh, damn it, it really hurts. I need like, some ointment or something. What is this? Spanish massage oil. Spanish massage oil? What happened here last night?
"
," Ted: I can't even look at you two right now.
"
," Ted: Good. Now, here's the thing. It sucks that you came back from Argentina with someone as awesome as Gael. And I know I have no right to be upset at you. We're broken up, life goes on, whatever. But you know what? We-we never did this. We-we had this polite breakup with no irrational yelling and that's just wrong. So I'm gonna yell irrationally for a while and you're just gonna have to stand there and deal with it, okay?
"
," Ted: (yells) I think I do! I really think I do! So now, I'm yelling!
"
," Ted: (yells) I did.
"
," Ted: (still yelling) I liked it too, but it was getting kind of hot. Maybe in the winter, I'll grow it back out! (quietly) Okay, I'm done.
"
," Ted: Look, us breaking up, it was the right thing. But it took some time to get over you, you know? I-I'm still getting over you. But you, you were over it the minute they started the in-flight movie.
"
," Ted: You weren't trying to win the break-up?
"
," Ted: Okay. No. See, look, that all sounds good, and we'll still be friends and move on, but..., did he have to be so hot? The guy's an Adonis.
"
," Ted: He's the Cadillac of rebound guys. Rodney has a crush on him. The guy's perfect.
"
," Ted: Oh, come on. He's hot, he windsurfs, he massages things. Name one way I'm better than that guy.
"
," Ted: Don't patronize me. If anything, he may even be a little bit taller.
"
," Ted: No, I just thought it would be cool to get a caterpillar tattoo, and then a few weeks went by, and all of a sudden...
"
," Ted: Well, I think you'll find I have a very high tolerance for pain. Just last night, I sat through the worst movie ever made.
"
," Ted: No, the worst movie... Manos: Hands of Fate.
"
," Ted: Uh-huh. I don't believe you, Doctor.
"
," Ted: Hey. Hey, put that away. Tonight's on me.
"
," Ted: Come on, I insist.
"
," Ted: Oh, wow. Oh, yay. Wow, thank you. One, two, three, four.
"
," Ted: No, it's just, um... I'm just a little embarrassed. I thought this was a date. But it's no big deal. Don't worry about it.
"
," Ted: Yeah, I got it.
"
," Ted: Yeah, yeah. Hey, you were right. Worst movie-going experience ever. Of course, it had nothing to do with the movie.
"
," Ted: No, it's fine. I got to hang out with you on girls' night out. All right, so if you're not allowed to date a patient, I'll just... I'll wait until these ten session are up and then I'll ask you out then.
"
," Ted: Really? I'm getting mixed signals from you. I feel like you've been staring at my ass for quite some time. What, you're married?
"
," Ted: Boyfriend?
"
," Ted: Lesbian?
"
," Ted: Only date black guys?
"
," Ted: And yet you can say with absolute confidence that ten weeks from now, if I ask you out on a date, your answer will be...
"
," Ted: This is far from over. We're talking ten weeks from now. Who knows what she'll want then? Do you know what you're going to want for lunch ten weeks from now?
"
," Ted: That's ridiculous.
"
," Ted: So we got off to a rocky start. That may be a problem for some guys, but I get better over time. Right? I'm not some Top 40 song... easily digestible. I'm complex. I require time and multiple listens. I'm 'Stairway to Heaven'.
"
," Ted: Give me ten sessions, I'm going to turn that ""no"" into a ""yes.""
"
," Ted: Yeah, well, I can handle pain. This one time I was playing tennis, and... (He screams in a high-pitched ton)
"
," Ted: Here's to nine more great sessions.
"
," Ted: Still no. What's up with that? I mean, I juggled.
"
," Ted: You do magic. How is juggling any lamer than magic?
"
," Ted: I don't get it. I mean...
"
," Ted: Anyway... I don't get it. She should be into me by now.
"
," Ted: I got four sessions left. Ther-There's got to be an angle I'm not seeing.
"
," Ted: Wait a second. Wait a second, I got the angle.
"
," Ted: The receptionist. That's my way in.
"
," Ted: That's not the plan. And how would that help me with Stella?
"
," Ted: Here's the plan.
"
," Ted: Hi. Here. I stopped... (He takes the bag back and wait for stella to be able to see him to give it back to Abby) Hi, I stopped for coffee and I... and I thought I'd grab you something.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: And now... we wait.
"
," Ted: Break it.
"
," Ted: Abby is...?
"
," Ted: Oh, Abby. I thought you said ""Alan.""
"
," Ted: Right. Right, I thought I said ""Alan.""
"
," Ted: Who's Abby?
"
," Ted: Exactly.
"
," Ted: What is happening?
"
," Ted: You're right, no more gimmicks. One more gimmick.
"
," Ted: You know what's on her shelf? That self-help book 'The Power of Me'.
"
," Ted: I know, I know, but I thought if I read it, maybe we'd have something new to talk about.
"
," Ted: Can I borrow your copy?
"
," Ted: Hi. Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.
"
," Ted: Telepathically?
"
," Ted: It's crazy. Yeah, I understand. I was just, uh, checking out the old bookshelf here. I see you've read 'The Power of Me'. It's funny...
"
," Ted: Oh, thank God. (chuckling) I couldn't agree more. That's total crap. I see people reading that on the subway and I just want to shout, ""Get a life, people!""
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: What? No, that's... that's not mine. I've never seen that before in my life.
"
," Ted: Wha... no, you have me confused with someone else.
"
," Ted: I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.
"
," Ted: No. I like Stella.
"
," Ted: What do you mean?
"
," Ted: What? What is it?
"
," Ted: What's the big secret?!
"
," Ted: Folliculaphilia?
"
," Ted: What is that?
"
," Ted: That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. That's not real.
"
," Ted: I know that you are because there's no such thing.
"
," Ted: Hi. Uh, Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.
"
," Ted: Why? Just why?
"
," Ted: Uh... okay.
"
," Ted: You sabotaged my next to last chance with Stella for ten dollars?
"
," Ted: This is awful. My-my tenth session is next week. I'm gonna ask her out, and she's gonna say the most demoralizing syllable in the English language... no. You know what? Just forget it. I'm not even gonna ask her.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God, you went and saw her, too.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: She said ""crush""? And she was talking about me?
"
," Ted: Stella...now that I'm no longer your patient, would you like to have dinner with me?
"
," Ted: Oh, no.
"
," Ted: I am gonna kill Henry.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God, this is worse than the laser.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: There it is... she's a mom. It's just not gonna happen.
"
," Ted: I'm good. I guess I got no one but myself to blame. She told me right from the start she was gonna say no and sure enough... Wait a minute.
"
," Ted: You didn't actually say no.
"
," Ted: All this time you were, uh, you were supposed to say no, but you didn't... I checked the transcript. So, here's what I'm proposing. Uh... You only have two minutes, right?
"
," Ted: Okay. You want to, uh... go on a a two-minute date with me?
"
," Ted: Great. And... go. Taxi!
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: 380 West 22nd, please. And step on it. We're in a hurry.
"
," Ted: Right this way.
"
," Ted: So, college?
"
," Ted: Uh-huh. Wesleyan.
"
," Ted: No. Scott Crable?
"
," Ted: Thanks.
"
," Ted: Could we get the check please. We're trying to make a movie in 15 seconds.
"
," Ted: Okay, great. Uh, how do you want to do this? You had the eggplant parm. I only really had water so... I'm kidding. Oh. Okay. Let's go. Taxi! You nervous?
"
," Ted: You can't tell at all.
"
," Ted: 384 West 22nd.
"
," Ted: Nah, previews. We'll be fine. Ah! Just in time. It hasn't started yet.
"
," Ted: Manos: Hands of Fate.
"
," Ted: Only the important parts. Worst movie ever.
"
," Ted: How we doing on time? Taxi!
"
," Ted: Okay. Do you want to walk it?
"
," Ted: So what grade's your daughter in?
"
," Ted: Ah! That's a good year.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Oh. Look, coffee and dessert?
"
," Ted: I know. New York. It's a living organism, an ever-changing tapestry. Ooh, look at the time. Let's go.
"
," Ted: Flowers?
"
," Ted: Okay. See? We're getting to know each other. Stella, I had a lovely... Doggy bag? Stella, I had a lovely time.
"
," Ted: And... date.
"
," Ted: That wasn't so bad, right? No lengthy, awkward silences. Dessert ran a little long, so... I had to cut the good-night kiss.
"
," Ted: Look, I would love to have a second date, I would. But I understand that you really don't have time right now, but if you ever do, will you give me a call?
"
," Ted: Okay.
"
," Ted: No, no, no, no!
"
," Ted: Ah!
"
," Ted: The addicts who have not sold their TV?
"
," Ted: My ex, Karen, is in New York. The usual routine.
"
," Ted: It was not that bad.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Bluntly.
"
," Ted: Bluntly.
"
," Ted: Bluntly.
"
," Ted: So, Karen in New York. Bizarre, no?
"
," Ted: I never said I'd do that. I thought it arrives. That would be the worst disaster if I called?
"
," Ted: You find pepperoni fascist and you're so right, so... (He finds Karen in bed with another) Oh, my God! Karen!
"
," Ted: I broke up with Karen.
"
," Ted: Super. Look who's here!
"
," Ted: It's gonna be 10,002 Maniacs, because I have tickets to Natalie Merchant...
"
," Ted: I was an idiot. It was my first real girlfriend. I was crazy about her. We've all done things we regret in college. In the third year, Kaylee has grown the goatee, wearing a beret and Rasta required to be called MJ Cool.
"
," Ted: So you really think that I should not call?
"
," Ted: OK, OK. Interesting information: it is already done.
"
," Ted: Because I will not invite him to lunch... again.
"
," Ted: I'd do that, of course... if he had not already occurred.
"
," Ted: It was a lunch and not eat wheat. It was nice to be back.We even laughed at the idiots we were.
"
," Ted: Say I had a picture of Moliere on my backpack.
"
," Ted: Bluntly pretentious.
"
," Ted: I hate change, but take us brushettes and fresh mozzarella. Grazie.
"
," Ted: It was great. There was an odd moment near the end.
"
," Ted: So...
"
," Ted: Karen was the first girl I really loved. And after the year I had, I dunno, I think of lunch with her reminded me what it was to turn 18 and life ahead. And I would remind everyone that at least I was wearing pants.
"
," Ted: That's all. It was just a kiss in a restaurant.
"
," Ted: As in a tree? No, it was not done in a tree. What is his problem?
"
," Ted: Jayden, let's be honest. We know both your motives. You hate Karen because she lingered.
"
," Ted: Why paint naked?
"
," Ted: Relax, it was just one night! And three after. And one morning. But at least I had pants. Even if, in fact, I had not.
"
," Ted: You know the sleeping pills you take for your crazy schedule? They are stronger than you think.
"
," Ted: False! You got to let the right answer in your pants, because that's exactly what did not happen.
"
," Ted: Sorry, dude.
"
," Ted: That was me. Me. The one time Tiffany forgot his pants?
"
," Ted: And you did not give him.
"
," Ted: Not this time.
"
," Ted: You have a boyfriend?
"
," Ted: You're unbelievable. You do not have the guts to break up with someone decent. So, you've preferred to ride it all.
"
," Ted: We're both zero for that. But... I think we need to change.Why do not I would start? You are really hurtful and reckless.Goodbye.
"
," Ted: Sorry, dude.
"
," Ted: Of course. And that for me, too. Later, she spoke with Jerry, and the discussion was that it avoided breaking with me.
"
," Ted: Right. On this subject... After breaking up with this guy, we went out, we slept since we're together. It's really okay, this time it's different. Here it is. Be nice!
"
," Ted: I wanted to watch it but I was too busy sleeping with this story. It took me all night, after 8 hours of the clock.
"
," Ted: Wow, you're going you do too.
"
," Ted: And on the couch, the bed and on the coffee table.
"
," Ted: Have fun.
"
," Ted: Leroy, going, going on the roof! We said no smoking in the apartment... after that you have set fire by the pumps.
"
," Ted: What are you doing, you have not smoked in 6 months. Is it about ""MacGrib""? It closed guy, forget it.
"
," Ted: So that's why you're worried?
"
," Ted: Is Arthur artillery? Your former leader.
"
," Ted: Is it always rebounded against you?
"
," Ted: Wow, he not remember you.
"
," Ted: Look, I understand you to be upset but this is not a reason to kill you.
"
," Ted: What will Scott say when you learn that you smoked?
"
," Ted: I can not believe they're smoking outside, it's really cold.
"
," Ted: I think there's a pretty girl smiling at me there.
"
," Ted: Guys?
"
," Ted: Our group is divided into smokers and nonsmokers, and it's great.
"
," Ted: And why you smoke there?
"
," Ted: We must stop smoking.
"
," Ted: Ok it's good, we stop.
"
," Ted: Johnni, we must do together.
"
," Ted: Damn Julio, think about it a moment, Blue Bug is the mayor anti cigarette. You really want to go to the interview smelling cigarettes? It's like interviewing a feeling the vegetarian steak.
"
," Ted: You stop! It all stops.
"
," Ted: We should just spend the first 24 hours after a piece of cake.
"
," Ted: Stephanie pass me your plate.
"
," Ted: Dude, if you do not stop moving your feet, I'll tear it off.
"
," Ted: Ok we'll do it now!
"
," Ted: You do not have to do that, you do not need to smoke.
"
," Ted: Good for her.
"
," Ted: Well look, the sun rises.
"
," Ted: A...
"
," Ted: So, I got up this morning, its freezing. So I walked over there. And I don't know why I am still talking. Because clearly we are all asking the same question. What in God's creation is going on with Gene's breasts.
"
," Ted: Um, something about fur trapping.
"
," Ted: Yeah, I'm also ""oot. Okay, now I'm really out.
"
," Ted: No! Tell me you did not load the drum set.
"
," Ted: Yes, you do. Whenever you haven't seen someone for a long time, no matter how much you want to deny it, there's always a clear winner and a clear loser.
"
," Ted: Point Luis.
"
," Ted: Wait. Do they have a wave pool?
"
," Ted: Okay, what the hell just happened?
"
," Ted: Huh! A water slide park. That sure is different than what Sharlene does.
"
," Ted: Um... (clears his throat)... okay. Go.
"
," Ted: No, I didn't know...
"
," Ted: Oh, well, sure. I mean, if I was actually...
"
," Ted: The Foreskins? How'd you guys come up with that name?
"
," Ted: Oh, it's actually a common thing. When you're around someone from your past, you kind of revert back to who you were when you knew them. There's not really a name for it, though.
"
," Ted: Yeah, I don't know about ""revertigo.""
"
," Ted: You don't know about Alfred and Michelle?
"
," Ted: Comparable.
"
," Ted: The coup de grace.
"
," Ted: Wait. You're going on a date with Simon? That Simon?The one we met?
"
," Ted: It's a stupid, made-up word with no meaning.
"
," Ted: Me?
"
," Ted: Okay, okay. First of all, his name is Adam Punciarello, and I don't do that.
"
," Ted: Ooh. That must be Adam. 'Sup, Punchy?
"
," Ted: You want to go?
"
," Ted: Dude, seriously, I'm sorry about your dad.
"
," Ted: I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this.
"
," Ted: No reason.
"
," Ted: Hey, so, today at work...
"
," Ted: Geez.
"
," Ted: Well... I'm sorry, Shawn.
"
," Ted: So, how's Columbia?
"
," Ted: There is, little lady. I've got a guest room.
"
," Ted: There he is.
"
," Ted: What are you doing?
"
," Ted: The best memories of our 20 years were held in it. It's not that throw stuff in a box. You look back at the past.
"
," Ted: But it is. Finally, everything changes. I will live with Stella, you will be in your new apartment. You start a new job in Tokyo. This is the end of an era. We should make a toast, but not with the usual sh1t. Your bottle of Scotch the most expensive.
"
," Ted: Excellent. A bottle of beer with it, and what do you think will cancel the Scotch?
"
," Ted: Look at this. A photo of the day we moved. So many good memories.
"
," Ted: So you keep a photograph?
"
," Ted: Why not?
"
," Ted: Like what?
"
," Ted: There is not enough drinks in the world that I drop my scourge.
"
," Ted: Wait, why I pay more?
"
," Ted: That's not true.
"
," Ted: An Encyclopedia ""World Book"" of 1986. It is with these that I grew up.
"
," Ted: Do you think we should say-die encyclo-pil. It's a common mistake. But if you look at the direction of the bar on the ""e"". The symbol of this encyclopedia, you'll know it is a diacritic which aims to change...
"
," Ted: Hello, good topics. Look what I won at the festival.
"
," Ted: Catch it, guys!
"
," Ted: Girls, stop!
"
," Ted: It's good enough!
"
," Ted: Katie's fault entirely. As fat burning on the mantelpiece, for that matter.
"
," Ted: About the hat.
"
," Ted: This is about the exaggerated English accent.
"
," Ted: It's weird. By removing the closet, I thought I saw the banner.
"
," Ted: And the flag was burned. Why new? And there are letters from you all, with ""Ted"" written on it. You prepare a response for me?
"
," Ted: That was why? The sandals? Hair products?
"
," Ted: My God, it was for Stella.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: You think I should not marry Stella. You think I should not marry.
"
," Ted: Obviously, it was not, it had agreed to make interventions more stupid to work on interventions.
"
," Ted: We made too many interventions.
"
," Ted: What was your biggest problem with me and Stella?
"
," Ted: Stella.
"
," Ted: You kept it on you?
"
," Ted: I want to hear the other letters.
"
," Ted: And if you changed yet? Go Tyler, listen to yours.
"
," Ted: I can hear yours?
"
," Ted: You've already read the intervention on my pronunciation. Where is the letter of Stella?
"
," Ted: Come on.
"
," Ted: Thank you. Because I really need you to handle it.
"
," Ted: Of course not. It's not like what you said was nonsense.You you were worried.
"
," Ted: But you score a point. It all happened very quickly.
"
," Ted: I guess, but we are still at the stage where one seeks to know himself. And Jeffery, you may be right. Stella will not like my stuff. As the robot pot cake. This is the first thing we bought here, remember?
"
," Ted: My collection of James Bond. You know, we looked at them in order, and... Tracey spoke with this weird English accent, until the next month?
"
," Ted: My cleats signed by Bernie Kosar. My lamp elephant.The English phone booth. My sombrero!
"
," Ted: I unpack. I never leave this apartment.
"
," Ted: I'm not ready for this responsibility, let alone to be the stepfather of a 7 year old daughter. If I get married and moved to the suburbs, in a twinkling, I exchange old!
"
," Ted: Hey.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Who wants to go to the same old bar, sit at the same place and drink the same thing? The same thing! My favorite!
"
," Ted: Oh, my God!
"
," Ted: I am moving to New Jersey.
"
," Ted: And you should move into the new apartment, and Shane should go to Japan.
"
," Ted: Because it will age like it or not, then the real question is: do we want to go forward or clinging desperately to the past and end up like that?
"
," Ted: You know what? I take care of the warranty. It makes me happy, because every hole in this apartment is a memory I will never forget. But on one condition: you put all 10 tickets aside every week for next year and come back here and buy this tape 50 years of age, and a toast to the incredible year full of change that we had it. Remove from us. My new family and I, Rodney and Mary, in their apartment and Claude in a number of English-language journalists in the West Pacific, ending up here in New York to celebrate this day... The day we closed one chapter of our lives incredibly, to open a new one.
"
," Ted: Remove from here.
"
," Ted: So, let's raise our glasses of scotch at $ 2 500 for a year of hell.
"
," Ted: It's smoky, with hints of cedar and old... You see the difference between that and tape for $ 10?
"
," Ted: Good idea. I have the tape.
"
," Ted: I will get my problem.
"
," Ted: Unfinished. Of all the words you could use to describe La Sagrada Familia... Brown, pointy, weird... The one that really seems to stick is ""unfinished."" Why? Because on June 7, 1926, the architect Antoni Gaudi... Whose beard was also brown, pointy, weird and unfinished......was run over by a bus. And so, his greatest masterpiece would remain forever...
"
," Ted: I don't know. Got a burger coming.
"
," Ted: Oh, man, it's bad enough to have to go through a horrible breakup, but then have that person pop up on your TV? Are you okay?
"
," Ted: That's great. Good for you.
"
," Ted: That's great.
"
," Ted: What are you doing here? Oh, God! You're dating one of my students. It's Rachel, isn't it? John, I know she wears provocative sweaters, but she's 19! Now I'm gonna have to hear all about it, right? Go on, tell me every detail.
"
," Ted: It's my building.
"
," Ted: Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean...
"
," Ted: Actually, I think I'm gonna say no.
"
," Ted: I do not want to work for GNB again. Those guys are evil. No offense, Tammy.
"
," Ted: For all we know, that was the contractor's fault.
"
," Ted: Look, I know this is hard to understand, but right now, I have a quiet, simple, happy little life. And I like it that way. I know what my answer has to be.
"
," Ted: I can't take the job, Roberto. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings?
"
," Ted: All right.
"
," Ted: I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Dale, back me up. Dale. Dude, this is important.
"
," Ted: Dolores, you want anything?
"
," Ted: Okay, I get that he's mad at me for turning down the job, but acting like I'm not even here?
"
," Ted: This morning.
"
," Ted: Am I wrong or is that exactly what Anthony says when he's putting the moves on a girl?
"
," Ted: Yeah, more like the opposite. He's been ignoring me all night. Regina wants me to take the job so bad he's putting the moves on me?
"
," Ted: I don't buy it. That's crazy, even for Steve.
"
," Ted: But Brennan hasn't done...
"
," Ted: I finally know what your kind goes through. I get it now.
"
," Ted: He did.
"
," Ted: Okay. Yep.
"
," Ted: You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese.
"
," Ted: Yeah... Cream cheese has a mild flav-flavor so it... it balances out the spiciness of the jal... the spiciness of the... Dude!
"
," Ted: Well, I mean, not exactly in those...
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: It's nice to be wanted, okay? And, yes, this is a new vest. Thank you all for noticing. Oh, that's right, you didn't. Sophia did!
"
," Ted: I am not that kind of architect. So get this...
"
," Ted: Anne, I gotta tell you something.
"
," Ted: Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower.
"
," Ted: Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, ""pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more."" It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, ""Oh, God, I never should have said no.""
"
," Ted: Oh, God, I never should have said no! Come on, GNB didn't really hire a new architect. This is just one of Raymond's moves.
"
," Ted: I didn't! I don't! I don't. I don't!
"
," Ted: Okay, I'll do it!
"
," Ted: I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: You guys lied to me?
"
," Ted: Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me.
"
," Ted: No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women...
"
," Ted:...before me fell for. Wow, respect.
"
," Ted: No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no.
"
," Ted: Unfinished. Gaudi, to his credit, never gave up on his dream, but that's not usually how it goes. I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy, weird church from getting built. Most of the time, it's just too difficult or too expensive, or too scary. It's only once you've stopped that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it. But it's always there. And until you finish it, it will always be...
"
," Ted: Hey, Ida. Hey, Rachel. Rachel, why aren't you in class?
"
," Ted: Not so fast. I'm not that easy.
"
," Ted: It's your p0rn collection.
"
," Ted: Hi, Minnie. A more.
"
," Ted: No, it's not a problem. I'll do it.
"
," Ted: Seriously, this is nothing. I'm on it.
"
," Ted: Let them! In a sense, it's sad, right? Julio who abandons his p0rn. He has love handles. They eat the same thing every night. We are witnessing the end of Julio Stinson as we know it.
"
," Ted: ArchiSexTure. That's not how you write ""Buckminster Fuller.""
"
," Ted: I get rid of this horrible pornography on the field.
"
," Ted: There is no reason to take it seriously, though?
"
," Ted: I spotted this girl there, and I will need help to land the plane.
"
," Ted: They kill.
"
," Ted: Samuel and Maureen are in love, but they are more Samuel and Maureen. They are big and old.
"
," Ted: This is obvious. Ethel eats too much because he hates to lose his freedom. Harry and stress because she hates what has become Ethel.
"
," Ted: It might be the problem. They are too similar. It's hard to have two dominant in a relationship.
"
," Ted: They are too stubborn. Neither wants to be the first to admit he no longer wants. They play at first that deflates.
"
," Ted: Talk about Space Orgy?
"
," Ted: What next?
"
," Ted: Find me someone.
"
," Ted: It's two against one.
"
," Ted: No need for it. We can do it alone.
"
," Ted: When I was with Brianna, you remember the only thing that made pinball?
"
," Ted: What are you talking?
"
," Ted: If Roy thinks for one second that Calvin wants to marry her, she Petera a lead and they will break.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: The server arrives.
"
," Ted: I've found. I have found. They maile images reminding those fights.
"
," Ted: Alan Thicke?
"
," Ted: This is your masterpiece.
"
," Ted: A van costs $ 25 more.
"
," Ted: What is that thing?
"
," Ted: Another robot? The stormtroopers are not robots.
"
," Ted: No one said this in Star Wars.
"
," Ted: A film of Dave begins like that.
"
," Ted: Now you mention the movie.
"
," Ted: A van is more expensive.
"
," Ted: If you work the costume, they will pay us.
"
," Ted: $ 25!
"
," Ted: You were in this video? The guy with the tan of a farmer?
"
," Ted: Come on. We find something else.
"
," Ted: Because they love.
"
," Ted: I thought that I would not say that this coir, but... Christian and Natalie, the happy couple.
"
," Ted: Really? I've never heard of them.
"
," Ted: What is Generation X?
"
," Ted: Don't think, Mosby! Do it now! Oh, my God, I'm doing it!
"
," Ted: I'm absolutely not playing laser tag.

," Ted: Wow, we finally found Erin's doppelganger. I guess we can tell you now, Eddie. That hot dog guy did not look like Erin.
"
," Ted: So, first day of work?
"
," Ted: Sandy Rivers?!
"
," Ted: Oh, I hate that guy.
"
," Ted: You had s*x with Sandy Rivers?
"
," Ted: Already? Were you planning on eventually sleeping with the host?
"
," Ted: So, second day of work?
"
," Ted: Oh, you didn't hear? She's the office slut.
"
," Ted: Ian, a word of advice: play along. Okay, the more you fight it, the worse it's going to get. It's like when your car slides on ice, you steer into the skid.
"
," Ted: Aren't you going to get it?
"
," Ted: He has to do that?
"
," Ted: So, third day of work?
"
," Ted: Oh, God. What did they find?
"
," Ted: You got attacked by an owl?
"
," Ted: Audrey, listen, here's what you need to do...
"
," Ted: Show me ""owl attack"".
"
," Ted: Uh... Okay, I did a bad thing last night. I looked up his address.
"
," Ted: Sorry. You said ""who"". It reminded me of the owl footage. Genius. No. Sandy. How dare he laugh at you. Who does he think... Sorry. ""Who"". Anyway. I looked up his address in your contact list.
"
," Ted: I just thought he needed to listen to common sense and reasonable discourse.
"
," Ted: They're my feet. I'm actually more of a kicker. So I went to his apartment.
"
," Ted: This is how you make sure Sandy never makes fun of you again. I told you to steer into the skid. That was bad advice. So new advice. Steer into Sandy, and run him down.
"
," Ted: Really? That's your take-away? Nothing on the bear in the bra?
"
," Ted: So? Possibly last day of work?
"
," Ted: Yes! Put him in a body bag!
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Owl?
"
," Ted: Yeah, go ahead.
"
," Ted: Guy is my best friend.
"
," Ted: My best friend does not, but still.
"
," Ted: Well, you renovate the library Nouillorc.
"
," Ted: No, not the New York Public Library. This is the library Nouillorc, in Dakota. Their books are in two parts: fishing and not fishing.
"
," Ted: Who's going to draw?
"
," Ted: Sven?
"
," Ted: I hate them. Swedish architecture collective.
"
," Ted: ""It is not a company. It is a collective. ""
"
," Ted: You realize what a hero I'd be if I brought this project to my box?
"
," Ted: What is it?
"
," Ted: I love to do that.
"
," Ted: Seriously, Lynn, from what I've lived with Stella, I have this opportunity... it touches me.
"
," Ted: Okay, be cool with me. This is a first draft.
"
," Ted: My way of saying thank you. Okay, you wanna see my designs for the building?
"
," Ted: And we think this design will radiate timeless power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen.
"
," Ted: Hey, Carlos! Give me the good news.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: I can not believe I had not. I thought I had hit the nail. Why did they choose Sven?
"
," Ted: It's really bad. After the way the last few months have passed... I guess I'd need more than I thought.
"
," Ted: I think I need it.
"
," Ted:... will radiate power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen.
"
," Ted: Wooo! (""My career and my love life going nowhere!"")
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Really?
"
," Ted: It's weird.
"
," Ted: Thank you, Dwight. I believe it. I brought in my box the largest contract that she had. Wooo! (""Now, only my love life is a disaster!"") The next is for me.
"
," Ted: I love you, man.
"
," Ted: You mount the bull?
"
," Ted: Oh, wow, Steve, this is... Oh, this is all of it.
"
," Ted: Hey,is that a toilet in your kitchen?
"
," Ted: God,I hope not. Hey, cool murphy bed.
"
," Ted: Hold on, I got it.
"
," Ted: Okay, we have to get Bernard out of that apartment. Her roommate is a raccoon.
"
," Ted: Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think she's a little more allergic to that.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: Well, I guess you could - well, you could try going to brunch alone.
"
," Ted: Of course, sweetie.
"
," Ted: Really? For brunch?
"
," Ted: Spare key! Brilliant!
"
," Ted: Hey, where have you been?
"
," Ted: By yourself?
"
," Ted: You invited him to brunch?
"
," Ted: Yes. That's why I was all ""you invited him to brunch?""
"
," Ted: Because brunch is kind of...
"
," Ted: I don't know. There's nothing girly about a horse, nothing girly about a horn, but put them together and you get a unicorn.
"
," Ted: Mamma mia!?
"
," Ted: No, totally. It sounds like a really, really fun, exciting, third date.
"
," Ted: You bros going to get dinner beforehand?
"
," Ted: Where at?
"
," Ted: What are you going to wear?
"
," Ted: Hey,you're home. I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning.
"
," Ted: Woah!
"
," Ted: Okay, that's not too bad. Two single guys on the prowl. It'll be like ""Wedding crashers"".
"
," Ted: You said no, right?
"
," Ted: I'm sorry. It's not funny anymore.
"
," Ted: Look,I don't think he's crazy. I just think he's suffering from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal. And unfortunately, you're his nicotine patch.
"
," Ted: Good man.
"
," Ted: Hold on. (To Miriam) Brad got him flowers. (They laugh) I'm sorry. It just got funny again. (Eleanor hangs up)
"
," Ted: That was great.
"
," Ted: Yeah, I know who you are.
"
," Ted: Totally looks fat.
"
," Ted: You're not serious, my students are going to catch me so I do them a lesson. I have not even my slide projector.
"
," Ted: Looks like you're not income from a lease, a guy called ""Big caramel"" you're passed.
"
," Ted: And you're ""Big caramel.""
"
," Ted: Who is Jenkins?
"
," Ted: Well it feels good to finally meet the famous Jenkins, after all these stories.
"
," Ted: What?!
"
," Ted: You want to sleep with Jenkins?
"
," Ted: But you are... really... I did not know that...
"
," Ted: It's going to seem crazy, but I thought Jenkins was a guy.
"
," Ted: I do not know, maybe history: Jenkins pissed out the window of a taxi.
"
," Ted: Yes.
"
," Ted: Wait, if you tell me that you flirt with a woman other than yours, I'll pull out and hit you.
"
," Ted: Look, I understand why you have not told him? You really think she would be jealous too.
"
," Ted: Yes, it could be a problem.
"
," Ted: What Travis is going to buy a horse.
"
," Ted: That's so cute. But it's Scotty, one of my students, and he looks at me me. Weird that I'm more famous than you.
"
," Ted: And I have 30 students in my class, which means, go, 30 times your hearing. We're going to buy Scotty a drink for old teacher. Scotty then, a question on neoclassical architecture, and it's good.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Really?
"
," Ted: Uh, this is Professor Mosby.
"
," Ted: This is architecture. Go will study.
"
," Ted: Go!
"
," Ted: Of course she was not jealous, it is the dynamics of your relationship.
"
," Ted: Exactly, low in trying to conquer another out of reach, and the strong will go back down to be with the other person less.
"
," Ted: So, to end modern architecture is very short, experimented with the houses in V. (Maurice enters the classroom Ted) Excuse me one second. What are you doing here?
"
," Ted: It's your pen, and you have chewed the end, recently.
"
," Ted: No, it is not.
"
," Ted: Thank you for last, Tina.
"
," Ted: Really? You watch his show? It's like watching an aquarium lit, and less interesting. And now that I think, not even informed.
"
," Ted: The what?
"
," Ted: But um, it would seem, she often said.
"
," Ted: It was agreed that you do not speak of those things.
"
," Ted: Okay, I know. You remember the other night, the game of skee-ball, when you did your good score?
"
," Ted: Bluntly.
"
," Ted: Okay, I understand.
"
," Ted: Remove your hair in the bathtub once you're done? Looks like you want to make a bath mat.
"
," Ted: Oh, you're entertaining? Last night there were 3 minutes of silence where you tried to patch up your sweater.
"
," Ted:... You're a drinking game.
"
," Ted: That's why they watch. They did a drinking game on you.Every time you say ""But um"", they take a shot.
"
," Ted: Yes.
"
," Ted: So I guess it's not a great drinking game. This means that last night when we played with Marion, I was not drunk and I did not vomit on it. Except that I did these two things here, take this.
"
," Ted: And here's a few of his contributions to architecture and now... We remember him for just one thing. My friends this is the sad legacy of Gregorio... Franchetti Gazibo. Questions?
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Well, what can I say except... um But I am! I can always come? I will pay?
"
," Ted: It's not pretty!
"
," Ted: No, no, no, do not drink, it's a trap!
"
," Ted: My God, help us all!
"
," Ted: So we'll just have a quiet day course. Nobody is talking! No noise!
"
," Ted: No, no, no, please. Just goes away!
"
," Ted: Super. So I'll call you.
"
," Ted: I had the number of that girl. Look. Holly.
"
," Ted: You know what I'm going to do? I'll call on. I will do ""you remember me? It's been a "". It's funny because I just saw.
"
," Ted: This rule is completely outdated. They know exactly what you do. I have another rule. It's a bit crazy, but I call it, ""you like him, you call him.""
"
," Ted: My rule of three days, it is anything. Who invented it?
"
," Ted: I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking.
"
," Ted: Okay. I promise. I will call not before three days.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: This is my laptop, a text message.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: That's not true.
"
," Ted: Sorry, Christina.
"
," Ted: It's a breast.
"
," Ted: To call. Texting, it's different.
"
," Ted: I make no noise.
"
," Ted: Holly just told me what she wears. It's pretty exciting.
"
," Ted: How do you know?
"
," Ted: Okay, maybe she's lying on the architectural magazines.No. This is bad.
"
," Ted: She just sent me a message clearly intended for someone else.
"
," Ted: Come down.
"
," Ted: I wear them right now and they are very sexy.
"
," Ted: I'm in love with you.
"
," Ted: Holly explained everything to me, it was just a misunderstanding. All is well now.
"
," Ted: Apparently, his idiot friend of Marsha accidentally used his phone for a message to her husband Billy.
"
," Ted: And now I feel better than ever. It sounds crazy, but I think that I am attached to this girl.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Wait. It was them all along? So Holly was not in his bath?Or sitting by the window, gazing at the stars thinking of me? Or on his couch cheerleader reading architecture magazines?
"
," Ted: It's true.
"
," Ted: Incredible!
"
," Ted: Or... I send them a text message that will really confuse them.
"
," Ted: Not bad. And: ""I killed a man with a shovel, and those feelings resurface""?
"
," Ted: ""I've never told anyone but I slept with the mother of my best friend. ""
"
," Ted: Wait. I think I have.
"
," Ted: It's a bit weird, but... I had a strange dream yesterday. It's a bit embarrassing.
"
," Ted: That's what happened.
"
," Ted: Then at the end of the meal, Frank Gehry addition to the slides and IM Pei said, ""Friend, tonight is your name I Paye.""Buckminster Fuller was almost choking. And I woke up.
"
," Ted: Of course.
"
," Ted: And.. why should I ""make me"" one of you?
"
," Ted: It's hard. I imagine it would be... Holly. Chloe told me everything. That's why I invented everything. Guys, here is Holly. And I have not waited for your precious three days to call. I knew where she was working so I found. Let me ask you? It was too early?
"
," Ted: Holly and I are going to dinner.
"
," Ted: I do not need help, OK? I can look after myself. And yes, maybe some girls do not like to be called away or they may say too, but guess what? These are not good for me. Maybe the good is the one that loves me to do that, because... this is who I am and I will not change because of a stupid rule of the Three Days. Holly spells his name with an ""I"".
"
," Ted: Okay, quick,
"
," Ted: Kelly!
"
," Ted: My hand.
"
," Ted: Dude, open your eyes. You're going to hurt yourself.
"
," Ted: Oh, yeah. After you left, we, uh, we unplugged it because it reminded David of how you used to, you know, leave messages. But hey, you guys are back together. I say we're plugging it back in. It's good to have you back.
"
," Ted: Yes, same Clint.
"
," Ted: Oh, fudge.
"
," Ted: I-- That was Soham, that was Soham.
"
," Ted: That was Willard.
"
," Ted: You know, it may have been me, but it was so long ago. Man, that machine, it really garbles your voice.You know, it almost made it sound like I said...
"
," Ted: Okay. That's it. You're never going to get over her until you stop putting her on a pedestal. So no more ice cream until you tell me one thing that's wrong with Jose.
"
," Ted: Okay. She called off your wedding and dumped you to be a painter in San Francisco. What do you call that?
"
," Ted: There you go.
"
," Ted: Remember that time we heard her laughing and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's, but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?
"
," Ted: Yeah!
"
," Ted: I was trying to help him. I'm his best friend. That's the best friend's job.
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word.
"
," Ted: Grinch. You timed that didn't you?
"
," Ted: Oh, yeah. ""I'm sorry"" were the first words out of my mouth.
"
," Ted: I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing. I was just trying to put the guy back together. You smashed him to pieces.
"
," Ted: No!
"
," Ted: Because, Susan, this summer, you were kind of a Grinch.
"
," Ted: That's not my middle name.
"
," Ted: Like you've never said that word.
"
," Ted: Are you sick?
"
," Ted: No, I meant do you have a cold?
"
," Ted: I should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve.
"
," Ted: Ahh... Three flights of stairs, not a drop spilled. Hey, buddy.
"
," Ted: Yeah, this is our thing. In college, whenever I wanted to make up with her, I'd buy her a beer. Cute, right?
"
," Ted: She took the decorations. She took the decorations! What a Grinch!
"
," Ted: All right. I guess I have to call her, right? Stephen's cell phone. She'll listen to reason-- right? Oh, hey, Billy. Actually, funny thing--the voice dial got you. I was trying to call... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. (20 minutes later) Yeah, the holidays are a rough time for everyone, Billy. Okay, yeah, dinner next Wednesday. Okay. Damn voice dial.
"
," Ted: Peyton!
"
," Ted: Um, Julio? Where are the Christmas decorations?
"
," Ted: You want to bring them back so we can celebrate Christmas together-- please?
"
," Ted: Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.
"
," Ted: Jessie, if you don't bring that stuff back right now, we...
"
," Ted: Freddie...
"
," Ted: Damn it! I could be in Cleveland right now making peppermint lager with my dad.
"
," Ted: Joyce gets home in three hours. He's gonna show up--no Lauren, no winter wonderland.I gotta get up to the Bronx.
"
," Ted: Hey, dude, how's the paper going?
"
," Ted: Oh... so magical.
"
," Ted: Sure does. Look, I gotta go.
"
," Ted: Ah, yeah, but, you know... decorations, is that really what Christmas is about?
"
," Ted: Uh, try the birth of Christ. You know, Christmas-- Christ Mas, which means ""More Christ"" to our Spanish friends.
"
," Ted: Right. I gotta go.
"
," Ted: You know, honestly, they taste a little store-bought. Oh! I got another call.
"
," Ted:  Right. (he hangs up end takes the other call)- Hello?
"
," Ted: Oh. Uh, hey, Mom. Merry Christmas.
"
," Ted: Oh, God, she called you?
"
," Ted: No, Mom, why would it be about Clint?
"
," Ted: Hey, Clint. Listen, um, I don't really have time to...
"
," Ted: Pizza delivery.
"
," Ted: You really thought I was the pizza delivery guy?
"
," Ted: Yeah, well, I brought a beer, but I gave it to a homeless guy. All right, he took it from me. Now, will you please come home?
"
," Ted: Okay, I'm sorry for calling you a... that word, over the summer, and for saying it again today. And for thinking it a lot on the subway ride over. I had no right to say that. It was hurtful and immature and I'm sorry.
"
," Ted: I'm not mad at you.
"
," Ted: I am not mad at you, Jeff. Now, can we please just...
"
," Ted: Because you never apologized to me. Dave's not the only one you walked out on. You leave for three months, you don't even call. Come on, Heather, we're supposed to be friends!
"
," Ted: You were a Grinch!
"
," Ted: Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.
"
," Ted: Yeah, I'm sure God cares if I...
"
," Ted: Fine. I don't want to ruin Christmas. You can have the apartment. Don't worry about seeing me there I'll be in Staten Island with my cousin Stacy. Just.... Merry Christmas.
"
," Ted: Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird. You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees. And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name when he wants to trick us.
"
," Ted: Was that a sincere offer?
"
," Ted: Stay there. Save yourself. We'll spend all day together tomorrow. Okay. Oh, how's Margie feeling?
"
," Ted: You're gonna be a great mom.
"
," Ted: Wow, that's a great gift.
"
," Ted: Oh, man, I know something you could get her that would blow her mind. Ready? Eight years ago...
"
," Ted: Easy Bake Oven--that's what I'm going to call my van.
"
," Ted: Dude... how was the concert?
"
," Ted: Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents.
"
," Ted: No, dude, real presents.
"
," Ted: Uh, you know what, why don't you say it. I really wouldn't know what to say.
"
," Ted: That's a great idea, Charity. But, really, I don't know. I mean how do you choose your favorite passage? It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones... That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool. Doorbell rings. Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in.
"
," Ted: Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers. Katrina starts singing. Frances and Anna follow.
"
," Ted: I accept. Give me the beer. it is so good to see you guys.
"
," Ted: Totally. But first, Constance, I owe you an apology.
"
," Ted: Yes
"
," Ted: Yes. And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again.
"
," Ted: Nothing. It's something you shouldn't say.
"
," Ted: So then this hot intern leans over my desk, I can totally see she has a pierced... (Jose and Peyton walk across the room) Brosnan. Pierce brosnan is my favorite of all the bonds.
"
," Ted: I'm gonna help marshall pay.
"
," Ted: yeah, this is going to be great. Just the five of us, right?
"
," Ted: How many days are in october?
"
," Ted: Dude, I thought we cleared this up last year.
"
," Ted: Is also tomorrow.
"
," Ted: How old is he?
"
," Ted: Hey, man, how are you?
"
," Ted: Parents?
"
," Ted: Unbelievable. Yolanda is dating Orville Redenbacher.
"
," Ted: How are you guys not seeing this? He's 150; Theodore's 27. Devon, come on,what do you got?
"
," Ted: Hey, uh, what time are you guys going to robin's?
"
," Ted: Perfect. Just to be safe, I'll get there like 8:00, 8:30.
"
," Ted: Sorry I'm late. Where are Violet and Joseph?
"
," Ted: Is Bob coming?
"
," Ted: So it's...
"
," Ted: Pies. They're things that friends make together.
"
," Ted: Great.
"
," Ted: Great. Well, this is great. It'll give us a chance to catch up.
"
," Ted: I'm going to make a phone call. (On the phone with Clifton who is at the Bar) Hey, it's me. listen, you have to come over here and make pies.
"
," Ted: Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver. It's still kind of weird being alone with Alfredo, but if you were here...
"
," Ted: You're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?
"
," Ted: So you're not coming to make pies.
"
," Ted: Hey, happy Thanksgiving.
"
," Ted: yep.
"
," Ted: Lucas?
"
," Ted: You may not realize this, but since we broke up, Miriam and I have never really been alone together.
"
," Ted: So we're in the kitchen, starting on the pies, and we realize, we don't have a damn thing to say to each other.
"
," Ted: I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now. You just feel like everything you say is gonna make things worse.
"
," Ted: I wanted to leave, but i couldn't stick her with making all the pies by herself. She was exhausted.
"
," Ted: Remember last year's Thanksgiving, when we had s*x seven times?
"
," Ted: What?! I thought it would break the ice.
"
," Ted: Ooh, the oven's pre-heated!
"
," Ted: Pecan pie? Why are we making that?
"
," Ted: You're allergic.
"
," Ted: So we're making a pie for Bob.
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: You know, you could have just told me it was for Bob.
"
," Ted: Upset me? Wait a second. Do you think that......Do you think that I'm jealous of Bob?
"
," Ted: Yes.
"
," Ted: Because he's a thousand years old.
"
," Ted: The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that we can only talk about the first Thanksgiving,
"
," Ted: The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is because I heard noah gave him shotgun in the ark.
"
," Ted: The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that I'm just an architect, but he discovered fire. How do you top that?
"
," Ted: I'm not. I'm just joking around. That's what friends do.
"
," Ted: Well, how come we're all allowed to bust on barney when he dates some skanktron, but when you sleep with the crypt keeper's dad, I'm not allowed to say a word?
"
," Ted: Hey, that is...
"
," Ted: Yeah, if you and i are such good friends, why couldn't you just tell me that's what we were doing? Okay, maybe we should talk about this later. I-I should get going.
"
," Ted: I don't know. I'm sorry. This is stupid.
"
," Ted: me, too.
"
," Ted:: There's office material...
"
," Ted: Clearly, we need to ignore this.
"
," Ted: Stuffed mushroom?
"
," Ted: Did you know that some mushrooms are carnivorous? Probably... not?
"
," Ted: Wait, wait, wait, wait. why would you be mad... you started it?
"
," Ted: We called a truce, we hugged, and when I tried to pull away, you kept your hand on my neck.
"
," Ted: Oh, come on! You leaned into it.
"
," Ted: Yeah. You're like the crappy kid in little league who knows he's not going to make contact, so he just...""Oops, I got hit by the pitch. Better take my base.""
"
," Ted: My on-base percentage was off the charts!
"
," Ted: Apparently not.
"
," Ted: We aren't friends, are we? Not really. We avoid each other. We smile politely. We're two people who pretend to be friends because it would be inconvenient not to.
"
," Ted: Maybe we should.
"
," Ted: I suppose... we eat dinner. And then that's it.
"
," Ted: Happy Thanksgiving.
"
," Ted: Guess we're not.
"
," Ted: This is gonna be majoy cleaner.
"
," Ted: Hi.
"
," Ted: For me it's Ted.
"
," Ted: I was left on the altar, there is one month.
"
," Ted: It was a complete disaster and since then I have not even managed to look at another woman. Except the old lady in the subway that makes break dancing. I look at it that way. I just watched. Finally, it is an old lady who made the break dance.And it is good. I will give him a dollar, the next time. Let's pretend I said it: These travel lift were asleep the moment of my week, and I would like to see you Friday night. In a lift. At the restaurant, nice. What do you think?
"
," Ted: You're who?
"
," Ted: What are you doing, Mitch?
"
," Ted: Leonard did not use the super secret signal. We put the old menu on the handle. This restaurant had to close. Mr. Popol...No need to explain why it's funny. I'm off. When leaving, take the pillow with you. This is a waste now.
"
," Ted: Apparently, our sweet, innocent, little Edwin led a lover. A young skinny named Mitch.
"
," Ted: Excuse me one minute.
"
," Ted: What action?
"
," Ted: ""The guy naked?""
"
," Ted: No chance it works!
"
," Ted: Two out of three?
"
," Ted: How do you know?
"
," Ted: I'd rather not.
"
," Ted: It does not work really.
"
," Ted: Two out of three. He assured me.
"
," Ted: It worked.
"
," Ted: So, it's going to be, a roommate? I come home, and guys with whom you will go out sitting on the couch, naked.
"
," Ted: I can not believe that ""The guy with hair 'market has on you.
"
," Ted: The s*x ""hotel room"".
"
," Ted: ""The co-pilot who jumps on the grenade to a friend.""
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: This is the first girl I had the courage to invite, from Stella.

," Ted: This is the eighth place I try tonight! I cut my hair 3 times! I am out!
"
," Ted: It's not the makeup! It is a sun cream with a subtle shade of... It is for men. It's good, I want my eyes stand out.
"
," Ted: No, Beth, I like Vicky. It could be serious. I want to do anything stupid to jeopardize that.
"
," Ted: Me too!
"
," Ted: I do. I ""The guy naked""!
"
," Ted: The evening started well, but... not as good as I hoped.
"
," Ted: What, this old stuff?
"
," Ted: When I realized that there was no future in this relationship, I decided to do.
"
," Ted: It's a good question. I have not really thought.
"
," Ted: And the ""Captain Morgan""?
"
," Ted: The Thinker?
"
," Ted: Mr. Clean?
"
," Ted: What do you think of the good old ""Baby Cadum""?
"
," Ted: I gotta go.
"
," Ted: It's nice home!
"
," Ted: Damn!
"
," Ted: Pablo Neruda.
"
," Ted: ""The naked guy"" works! I just sleep with a horrible person. I'm back!
"
," Ted: You're not the only one who provided e ""Dude-haired.""
"
," Ted: Pretty! What made you ask?
"
," Ted: My God! Guys, guys! That's him! This is ""The guy naked""!
"
," Ted: Wait, Mitch, I have to thank you. We all tried ""The guy naked,"" tonight.
"
," Ted: I want you to know tonight, as crazy as it was, took me out of my shell.
"
," Ted: A toast... Mitch. The sum of its parts makes him a man.But when it serves its parts, it becomes much more. It does not fit the definition of a hero, but he is the one I needed. The hero who helped me get over the disaster of the failure of my marriage and I was almost back in the saddle. He lives in the shadows. Is this a dream? The truth? A fiction? Damnation?Salvation? It is all that and also, no nothing. Because it is...""The guy with hair.""
"
," Ted: That Friday, I met Lonnie to see how it went at ""fire o'clock.""
"
," Ted: What is she doing for money through all this?
"
," Ted: Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?
"
," Ted: I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: Dylan, nothing to add?
"
," Ted: I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this.""
"
," Ted: What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?
"
," Ted: Yeah. Somebody did just quit.
"
," Ted: So, where should we eat today? (looking at the assistant with a whole chicken in a container) Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? (the girl leaves, crying)
"
," Ted: It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.
"
," Ted: It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?
"
," Ted: So, Phyllis, what do you say? Do you want the job?
"
," Ted: Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.
"
," Ted: You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.
"
," Ted: Yeah. Here's the model.
"
," Ted: I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: Jean, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Jean's going to be our new office assistant.
"
," Ted: I, uh... I am an architect.
"
," Ted: Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.
"
," Ted: Absolutely.
"
," Ted: Styrofoam trees.
"
," Ted: Styrofoam trees.
"
," Ted: Styrofoam trees!
"
," Ted: He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: It's nothing.
"
," Ted: Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough!
"
," Ted: Okay, I'm done.
"
," Ted: Great. Thanks.
"
," Ted: Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.
"
," Ted: Too green?
"
," Ted: I can't un-picture it.
"
," Ted: What? What's gone?
"
," Ted: Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.
"
," Ted: Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.
"
," Ted: Inspiring as always, sir. Mason? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Mason's desk drawers and find the ball)
"
," Ted: Hey. Um, Kenneth, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?
"
," Ted: Why?
"
," Ted: What does his ball have to do with anything?
"
," Ted: Ronnie stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.
"
," Ted: You know about this?
"
," Ted: So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?
"
," Ted: That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.
"
," Ted: Eva, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.
"
," Ted: A note?
"
," Ted: Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.
"
," Ted: When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.
"
," Ted: What do you mean, no?
"
," Ted: Come on, Martha. We're running out of time.
"
," Ted: Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.
"
," Ted: This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.
"
," Ted: No. You'll give it back or you're fired.
"
," Ted: Then you're fired.
"
," Ted: Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Timmothy.
"
," Ted: Jeremiah was mentally deranged.
"
," Ted: Beverley was mentally deranged!
"
," Ted: Wait! We have one more idea for you.
"
," Ted: I have another design.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.
"
," Ted: Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...
"
," Ted: What happened?
"
," Ted: And inspired by a character on Woodworthy Manor,
"
," Ted: Victoria was great.
"
," Ted: Okay, I need to figure out if Victoria ever got engaged.
"
," Ted: And only 60% of them are prisoners.
"
," Ted: It's terrible. And bad... also.
"
," Ted: The problem may be your CV. Have you seen like mine is ventilated? Yours is too busy.
"
," Ted: No one knows. It was a mysterious and awesome DJ.
"
," Ted: His identity is still secret.
"
," Ted: But this phantom waves changed the face of the campus radio.
"
," Ted: No. We will not let them. One of us will help you find.
"
," Ted: Maybe there is something in it that people do not like.We'll watch it, OK?
"
," Ted: You've put champion dunk in your CV?
"
," Ted: You can dunk more.
"
," Ted: I have a technical question. Is it easier to dance when you do not have external genitalia?
"
," Ted: Is that you? You INTERVIEWED yourself?
"
," Ted: And a little Scottish.
"
," Ted: You were supposed to be on a motorcycle to say that?
"
," Ted: It's you again...? You sing a song about you?
"
," Ted: Impossible.
"
," Ted: I've taken a light beer. I know the dancers count calories.
"
," Ted: As a vaginal rejuvenation?
"
," Ted: Who?
"
," Ted: It was perfect!
"
," Ted: Violet and I are the only ones here with sh1t on our resume?
"
," Ted: What it's related to your job as mistress?
"
," Ted: Guys!
"
," Ted: Florence must leave Canada.
"
," Ted: 33!
"
," Ted: Why nobody comes to my events?
"
," Ted: What are you... What you're talking about?
"
," Ted: Oh, it's the same exact spelling as my name.
"
," Ted: Oh my God. This totally explains the thing at my doctor's the other day.
"
," Ted: This is really bizarre. The only other famous Mosby I know was a confederate general during the civil war.
"
," Ted: You got the job! Oh, yeah!
"
," Ted: Congrats, buddy.
"
," Ted: Yeah, it really is.
"
," Ted: Uh, no. No, navigators have three stripes on their hats. Captains have four. That guy's a captain.
"
," Ted: No, that's not him. What do you mean, ""that"" Ted Mosby really knows what he's doing?
"
," Ted: Who is this guy? Are we related? Do, do I look like him?
"
," Ted: Ah, ah, very funny, Wendy. Now we know you watch p0rn. (She leaves) This Ted Mosby must be getting kind of famous.
"
," Ted: Shh.
"
," Ted: Adult Video Weekly? Oh, no...
"
," Ted: Hello?
"
," Ted: Oh my God! (To Kaylee and Stephanie) AVW? It's architecture vision weekly.
"
," Ted: Well, I don't want to say it's my project. I mean, I'll be working with at least three partners.
"
," Ted: Yeah. Yeah. I'm really looking forward to it. I mean, I know they're gonna ride me pretty hard but they're great guys.
"
," Ted: That interview went on for 20 more minutes.
"
," Ted: What? Okay, this is getting creepy. Who, who is this guy? I gotta find him.
"
," Ted: So... what do you think?
"
," Ted: But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?
"
," Ted: Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Ronnie, so... I gotta do this. (Joy slaps him) Ow! What the hell?
"
," Ted: One more. One more time. One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture. And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it. If it's yes, great. If it's no, then I am done going after Bertha forever.
"
," Ted: I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Deann, I'm going to need the spare key to Darrell's apartment.
"
," Ted: Remember the first night Katherine and I went out? I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.
"
," Ted: She should be here any second.
"
," Ted: Enough with the... we'll go get pizza later, all right? Just...
"
," Ted: Hi.
"
," Ted: Arianna... I've sort of said this already. I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly. So this is me, just saying it. With strings. I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together. What do you say? What do you say?
"
," Ted: Those are the three options.
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait.
"
," Ted: No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards. Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here.
"
," Ted: Okay. Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?
"
," Ted: Right. Come on.
"
," Ted: I know. But... come on...
"
," Ted: Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane. Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious. I'm kidding. I'm serious.
"
," Ted: I thought that thing was canceled.
"
," Ted: Since when?
"
," Ted: Oh, you're kidding me. No way. Don't go on this thing.
"
," Ted: Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date. With Sandy... and his weenie. I mean is this not a date?
"
," Ted: So, what? You actually like this guy now?
"
," Ted: Are you gonna hook up with him?
"
," Ted: Yes, you do.
"
," Ted: I don't plan out every...
"
," Ted: Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point? God, you are so terrified of anything real. It's like you're floating out in space. Touch the ground, Sharlene. Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake.
"
," Ted: Fine.
"
," Ted: If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that.
"
," Ted: Then I guess it's not meant to be.
"
," Ted: Screw that. This ain't over.
"
," Ted: I don't care what I said. This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be. It is meant to be, and you know why? 'Cause I mean it to be.
"
," Ted: Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is.
"
," Ted: I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Katie go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain!
"
," Ted: Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?
"
," Ted: Are you still in touch with her?
"
," Ted: Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.
"
," Ted: Yes.
"
," Ted: Yes.
"
," Ted: Yes. (Hugh slaps him once again and Ted slaps him back. Hugh tries again to slaps Ted but he stops him) We're finding Penelope!
"
," Ted: Yes, we are!
"
," Ted: Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend.
"
," Ted: There's this girl...
"
," Ted: Penelope, this is the girl I love. If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy. Please.
"
," Ted: Absolutely.
"
," Ted: Kind of.
"
," Ted: Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?
"
," Ted: Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance?
"
," Ted: Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?
"
," Ted: No?
"
," Ted: Have you ever seen a rain dance?
"
," Ted: Terrific. Uh, look, I should run. I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R. I can't believe this. We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves.
"
," Ted: A rain dance.
"
," Ted: Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour.
"
," Ted: Yeah. I know that.
"
," Ted: Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work. But it has to work! You hear me, universe? This is Ted Mosby talking! Give me some rain! Come on! Come on! Come on...!
"
," Ted: Joseph! Hey, Joseph! (Joseph opens up her window) Oh, thank God you're here!
"
," Ted: I know. I'm sorry.
"
," Ted: Yeah, it is. Come down here.
"
," Ted: No, you have to come down here.
"
," Ted: Why? Because I made it rain, that's what I did today! And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!
"
," Ted: I'm not coming up there, Glen, I'm not. You have to come down here!
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: What happened?
"
," Ted: What was it?
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up. It's the man version of getting a cat.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: You have a boat?
"
," Ted: Your boat is sinking. That was good.
"
," Ted: Ah, no thanks. I don't need an algorithm to meet women. It's New York City. You know, plenty of fish in the sea.
"
," Ted: That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?
"
," Ted: Do you take credit cards?
"
," Ted: Dude, is everything OK? You left the front door open.
"
," Ted: She said it'd take three days. It's been five days. Should I be worried?
"
," Ted: Did you just use my name as a verb?
"
," Ted: OK, I get it. Don't worry, I'm not gonna ted anything up or out. I'll just give it a few more days.
"
," Ted: Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.
"
," Ted: You said it was gonna be three days.
"
," Ted: Hm.
"
," Ted: Yeah. When someone says you're gonna meet the perfect woman in three days, you gotta put that in your datebook, so...
"
," Ted: There are no women for me out there? I thought you said there were 8.
"
," Ted: But, I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute. I'm a cute architect.
"
," Ted: Well, I'm not.
"
," Ted: No. You're messing with me, right?
"
," Ted: There's a 9.6 right there.
"
," Ted: What about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?
"
," Ted: So he sucks.
"
," Ted: Oh, sure, it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?
"
," Ted: My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.
"
," Ted: OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin.
"
," Ted: All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?
"
," Ted: Hi.
"
," Ted: I'm Architect Mosby. Sorry I just wanted to say my job too.
"
," Ted: Hi, I'm Ted.
"
," Ted: I have a kind of mole on my back. It's probably nothing but I'm a cautious guy.
"
," Ted: Sorry about that, Summer Breeze is my guilty pleasure song.
"
," Ted: Oh, it's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend at brunch.
"
," Ted: It's the best, as long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies.
"
," Ted: Hey, this may sound weird but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off so I'm gonna ask you now. Do you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?
"
," Ted: Friday night?
"
," Ted: Wow, you're getting married. Congratulations.
"
," Ted: I'm really sorry I asked you out. If just felt like there might be this weird connection between us. How crazy am I coming off here?
"
," Ted: Well, by some million to one shot, and I'm not rooting for this, you wind up not getting married this weekend, give me a call.
"
," Ted: I'm sure you do.
"
," Ted: So, my 9.6, beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged.
"
," Ted: Yeah, it was a long shot. I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mine, but I don't know...
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?
"
," Ted: Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.
"
," Ted: Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a shot.
"
," Ted: Hello again.
"
," Ted: Go ahead, Sarah, you can tell me anything.
"
," Ted: Anything else?
"
," Ted: Wait, then you're still getting married.
"
," Ted: But we're a 9.6.
"
," Ted: OK, I, I went to Love Solutions and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer that you and I are a 9.6. Your fiance's only an 8.5.
"
," Ted: I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious? The woman who set you up with your fiancé thinks we're a better match.
"
," Ted: Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?
"
," Ted: See, we're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other.
"
," Ted: Calm down! You're my only match! There was a computer and there were 8 fish in the sea full of lesbians.
"
," Ted: Didn't used to. There was math, I got confused.
"
," Ted: You're right.
"
," Ted: Hi Ellen. I think I want my money back.
"
," Ted: Come on, Ellen, I mean, a pint of ice cream isn't that a bit cliché?
"
," Ted: This isn't hopeless. You're gonna find someone for me.
"
," Ted: I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive. You just have to get back out there and keep looking.
"
," Ted: You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be up on that wall one of these days.
"
," Ted: Yes I will
"
," Ted: Point is, something good is going to happen to me. Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen.
"
," Ted: Of course you should. And now you're gonna do it for free.
"
," Ted: OK, where was I? It was June 2006 and life had just taken an unexpected turn.
"
," Ted: Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important. It's all part of the story.
"
," Ted: No. The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful. For me, it started out great. (In 2006, Ted and Harvey are kissing after the rain dance) In fact, day one was amazing. I'd finally gotten together with Harvey. But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life, your Uncle Isaiah had been having one of the worst nights of his (Ted finds Isaiah on their stairs, holding in his hand Walter's engagement ring).
"
," Ted: No! No! If you call her, when she asked you not to, you're just gonna look weak and you're gonna regret it. Now, listen. Whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first... and I will punch you in the face.
"
," Ted: You mean how David and Freddie broke up and David is gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night? Yeah, I think he knows.
"
," Ted: Hey Mae.
"
," Ted: Are you hungry?
"
," Ted: At least in that scenario, you get to do the dumping. Come on, it's Sunday, it's pancakes day!
"
," Ted: Are we still talking about her pancakes? Come on, you gotta eat something. What can I get you?
"
," Ted: No, that's what you had for dinner.
"
," Ted: You should write and illustrate children's books.
"
," Ted: It's only been a month. He just needs to goat his own pace. Anyway, lily is the one who caused this whole mess.
"
," Ted: Figure out who she is? She should call me. I got a whole list. She's selfish, she's immature, she's...
"
," Ted: God, your eyes are so blue.
"
," Ted: Uh-oh.
"
," Ted: He's calling her. Dammit!
"
," Ted: They were together nine years. It's only been a month and a half. He just needs to go his own pace.
"
," Ted: He watched a scary movie.
"
," Ted: Yeah, this is fun, right? We're outside, it's a beautiful day. The Indians are winning!
"
," Ted: Oh, no. (A man is proposing to his girlfriend. Scott stands up and throws a hotdog at the engaged couple.)
"
," Ted: We've tried everything. Baseball, strippers. The guy still won't eat a damn pancake. I think he's beyond repair.
"
," Ted: I'll hand it to you. When he got home, Jesse was smiling. Did you sleep with him? 'Cause I was actually like three days away from suggesting that.
"
," Ted: Well, congratulations. You're the first person to cheer him up all summer. You win.
"
," Ted: I'll tell what you win. I'm taking you away this weekend.
"
," Ted: My aunt and uncle have a beach house at Montauk. It's really romantic. My uncle had, like, three affairs there.
"
," Ted: Really? Hey, thanks. And hey, if you need anything, day or night, just call me. You know what? Please don't call me. What? What's wrong?
"
," Ted: So?
"
," Ted: No, no. No good can come from looking at this. You've made too much progress already.
"
," Ted: That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
"
," Ted: Exactly!
"
," Ted: Why do you talk? Why do you talk?
"
," Ted: No! You're not calling her. This changes nothing. (To Jerome) You, come here. (Jerome and Gertrude follow Ted in the kitchen). While we're away this weekend can you keep an eye on him? Make sure he doesn't call her hotel.
"
," Ted: Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this. (To Georgia) Come here my little baby. (Ted and Georgia are making out)
"
," Ted: Fred! Fred!
"
," Ted: Everything we've worked so hard for...!
"
," Ted: Hang up now!
"
," Ted: Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up!
"
," Ted: Dude, you can't...
"
," Ted: Because you're pathetic! I'm sorry. But right now, you are not Tiffany. You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Tiffany and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Tammy. You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line? Tiffany. The real Tiffany. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Terri... Is it still OK if we borrow the car?
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: You think I was too hard on him.
"
," Ted: I can't believe you're accusing me to be too hard on him. You're the one who said tough love.
"
," Ted: Oh, but it's OK to hand him a 9 mm? Yeah. He told me. So you're a gun nut?
"
," Ted: Do you know how many people are killed...
"
," Ted: Alright, alright. I was too hard on him.
"
," Ted: I'm gonna call Allan, see how they're doing.
"
," Ted: Uh, hey. Where are you guys?
"
," Ted: Strip-club. Nice. Is Cathy OK?
"
," Ted: What? What uh-oh?
"
," Ted: You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel.
"
," Ted: Mason![End of the phone call]

," Ted: A really nice one.
"
," Ted: Hi. Uh, could you tell me what room Lance Aldrin's in? Thanks. Ritthy!
"
," Ted: What happened?
"
," Ted: You knocked out Marion's new boyfriend?
"
," Ted: What? Who was he?
"
," Ted: So Camila is not back in town and she doesn't have a boyfriend. That's good news, right?
"
," Ted: You know, first day at college, I showed up, I was so freaked out and I got up to my room and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall. He had headphones on, a big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap. Happy. Confident. Not afraid of anything. That guy was you. You before you met Tony.
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: What I'm saying is, there's a version of you without Regina and... It's not this. You can't let Regina stole your identity the way that guy stole hers.
"
," Ted: Cheers.
"
," Ted: Oh, what now? Marvin? What are you doing?
"
," Ted: She ruined crossword day! I can't believe this. She singles me out by name. Calls me a ""fat cat."" Me and my ""fat-cat friends."" We're not fat cats.
"
," Ted: They'd pelt us with their Phish bootlegs.
"
," Ted: Oh, hey. You guys seen Russell? I'm supposed to drive him to his mom's funeral.
"
," Ted: Next time we go to Great Adventure, you're carrying your own sunblock.
"
," Ted: Guys, guys, guys? Architecture fun fact: If you stand right here, and you whisper, a person all the way across the other end of the room hears it like you're standing right next to them. It's one of the most sophisticated pieces of acoustical design in the world. Watch. (whispers): Diarrhea. Right? Right?
"
," Ted: Zoey? Well, well, well.
"
," Ted: So, what are we protesting tonight? Rising cost of jet fuel? The government's oppressive top hat and monocle tax?
"
," Ted: Yeah, old stuff's great.
"
," Ted: So, Captain. How'd you get that name, anyway?
"
," Ted: Well, pleased to meet you, Captain. I'm Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville.
"
," Ted: The boat? There's a boat? You must tell me about this boat, Captain.
"
," Ted: She!
"
," Ted: Yes. The sea is all like, ""Ted, come hang out.""
"
," Ted: Man, I wish me and my dad were as close as you guys are.
"
," Ted: No, if I wanted to make it personal, I'd call you a bored little trophy wife who likes to play activist when the shops on 5th Avenue are closed.
"
," Ted: Down where? To the yacht club? Oh! I would love to. W-w-wait. I'm half Jewish, will that be a problem?
"
," Ted: Wieners and gonads.
"
," Ted: Boogers.
"
," Ted: Hershey squirts.
"
," Ted: Oh! Zoey! There you are. Oh, my God. You have a monocle. Is this real? Is this really happening?
"
," Ted: Good luck killing James Bond. (Zoey takes Ted away) Are we allowed in here?
"
," Ted: I want my crossword day back. Okay? Go live your perfect little life, and leave me the hell alone.
"
," Ted: Oh, please, what's your biggest problem? Having to sail back to the marina because the Captain's all out of white Zin? Oh. Great. Now you're crying. Like that's going to get my sympathy.
"
," Ted: He seems like a good guy. He wears those red pants.
"
," Ted: It's not crazy at all. I'm the same way. Look, Zoey, The Arcadian should be a landmark, it should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate that we have to tear it down. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of wieners and gonads.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: You tricked me.
"
," Ted: She caught me on tape trashing GNB.
"
," Ted: Really? You'd do that to your own wife?
"
," Ted: No, you know what? Don't erase the tape. And for what it's worth, I don't think she's throwing temper tantrums. I just think she's, you know, standing up for what she believes in. I respect that.
"
," Ted: I'm serious. It's a great look. I think it could come back, but one question. Does it cost half as much as glasses?
"
," Ted: Oh, I thought we were...
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Thanks.
"
," Ted: You look gross when you cry, you know that? Some women look cute. You look like a basset hound.
"
," Ted: Bring it on, Princess.
"
," Ted: Really?
"
," Ted: Heather had the writing translated.
"
," Ted: No, no, no-we're not playing ""Have you Met Ted!""
"
," Ted: I think I'm in love with you.
"
," Ted: I wasn't in love with her, okay? I was briefly in love with the abstract idea of getting married! That had absolutely nothing to do with Leon. (Finds Carmen and Leon chatting at a table.) Leon!
"
," Ted: Since when do you guys know each other?
"
," Ted: They just got engaged.
"
," Ted: Yeah, you too. (Glenda leaves, Kenzi walks closer) Damn it.
"
," Ted: I'm in love with her.
"
," Ted: I don't know! I just have this feeling. She's the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.
"
," Ted: Larry, you squeaked?
"
," Ted: She said something about me didn't she? Come on, spill it, Red.
"
," Ted: Huh... I'm gonna spin that as good. Lots of guys are ""something"", I'm ""something else"".
"
," Ted: But...that's part of my charm.
"
," Ted: She wants casual. Okay, I'll be casual. I'm gonna be a mushroom cloud of casual. You know why? Cause it's a game! I wanted to skip to the end and do the ""happily ever after"" thing but you don't get there unless you play the game.
"
," Ted: Yeah-No! I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out I'm asking her out. So how do I ask her out, without asking her out? (thinks)
"
," Ted: I got it! I don't ask her out... I invite her to our party next Friday.
"
," Ted: We are now-Casual
"
," Ted: No-calling's not casual! I just gotta bump into her somewhere. If only I knew her schedule I could arrange a ""chance"" encounter.
"
," Ted: Guys, boundaries! There she is!
"
," Ted: 75th in Columbus. (Gets up and grabs coat) Game on! (Leaves)
"
," Ted: (Turns around nonchalant) Jesse, wow! What are the odds?
"
," Ted: Oh, you know, just-uh-Shopping for-uh-dip (holds dip) I love dip... I mean I don't love dip, I like dip. As a friend, you know. So-uh-hey, you-uh-reporting a news story or something? (puts dip back)
"
," Ted: Wow, kid in a crane machine (approached machine. To boy) You just had to have that toy didn't ya? Couldn't play the game like everyone else.
"
," Ted: Cute kid (wipes forehead) Um yeah it's f-it's so funny running into your we're having a party next Friday if-if you like swinging by! But, you know, whatever.
"
," Ted: (Shocked) It is, it's tonight. This Friday, Did I say next Friday? Yeah-sorry-cuz I've been saying ""next Friday"" all week, but yeah it's tonight. The-uh-party's tonight. But, you know, whatever.
"
," Ted: (on Phone) hey, am I interrupting anything? (Holding party mixes)
"
," Ted: (on Phone) Yeah, well you and Jon might wanna put some clothes on. We're throwing a party in two hours. Okay, bye (hangs up)
"
," Ted: Okay, I got it all planned out.
"
," Ted: She steps through the door, and where's Ted? Not eagerly waiting by the door. Nah I'm across the room at my drafting table showing some foxy young thing all my cool architecture stuff. So Philip strolls over and I casually give her one of these, ""Hey, what's up?"" She says, ""Hey, nice place"" etcetera, etcetera. And then I say, ""Well make yourself at home,"" and I casually return to my conversation. Then, an hour later, ""Oh, you're still here?"" I say like I don't really care, but it's a nice surprise. And then very casually, ""Wanna see the roof?""
"
," Ted: Get her up to the roof and the roof takes care of the rest.
"
," Ted: We're the same height.
"
," Ted: That's not the plan.
"
," Ted: Yeah, but she's not Alberto.
"
," Ted: Elaine, I don't wanna say-
"
," Ted: No, come on not this.
"
," Ted: Hi.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: I don't think so.
"
," Ted: Whoa-whoa-Hey hey. I got that roof reserved!
"
," Ted: Hey, she's goanna show up. (Silence) She'll show up.
"
," Ted: You always know what to say old friend.
"
," Ted: It's Kurt.
"
," Ted: No, no, no. Not right away. I gotta seem casual. (Answers phone) Hello?
"
," Ted: Who is this? Merideth?
"
," Ted: Oh, Hunter! Hey, yeah, guess you never showed up did you?
"
," Ted: Did he get to keep the purple giraffe?
"
," Ted: (scoffs)
"
," Ted: It is the party's tonight. (Renee's mad) Yeah-uh-it's a two day party. Because that's just how we roll. Uh-so if you wanna swing by its-uh-you know, Casual. See ya. (hangs up) So that was Noah.
"
," Ted: I know I'm sorry. It's terrible (grabs coat) I'll buy more dip (runs out)
"
," Ted: I have no idea who that is.
"
," Ted: I don't know any Carlos.
"
," Ted: Whoa-Whoa rabbits! Come on, I got that roof reserved.
"
," Ted: Oh, that was fast.
"
," Ted: (straight-faced) Glad I could help.
"
," Ted: What the-no, no, no, no-come on!
"
," Ted: Great! What am I going to do when Arron shows up. (Silence) She'll show up.
"
," Ted: It's Diana. (sighs. Answers) Hello?
"
," Ted: Amanda? Oh, Denise-Sorry you totally sounded like Amanda (Does weird hand thing with Tony)
"
," Ted: Oh, Johnni-(laughs)-Hi.
"
," Ted: Hey, ain't no thing but a chicken wing mamacita. (To Alicia and Rene) WHO AM I?
"
," Ted: (Silence) It did indeed, the party continues tonight. (Frank grabs for him, Ted runs away) Yeah. Last night people were like, ""KEEP IT GOIN' BRO! PARTY TRIFECTA!""
"
," Ted: Great, see you tonight. (hangs up. Looks to Darren) So that was Norman.
"
," Ted: lame or ""Casual""?
"
," Ted: Or ""Casual""?
"
," Ted: No! Oh you thought that-oh, no! I c-okay yes. You got me-I-(laughs)-one of the reasons I threw these parties was so that I could introduce you to uh-(Pat throws Ted a random guy) this guy. I figured, you know, since it didn't work out between us and now we can just laugh about it (nervously laughs)-Anyway Bertha, this is.
"
," Ted: She's still talking to Carlos. I can still win this, it's not over.
"
," Ted: She's not just ""one of them"" she's the one.
"
," Ted: Nothing. It's a game, I gotta just-keep playing it.
"
," Ted: Hey. Carlos, can you give us a minute?
"
," Ted: Frank, look I didn't invite you to this party to set you up with Carlos. Or the one before that. Or the one before that. (Frank smiles) I threw these parties because I wanted to see you.
"
," Ted: There's something here, look, unless I'm crazy.
"
," Ted: Like what?
"
," Ted: I'm not gonna force sports on them unless they're interested.
"
," Ted: No, I'm not.
"
," Ted: (reaches in his Jacket) Click. Off. Let's make out.
"
," Ted: What? That was the off switch! And I turned it off. I mean sure yes, I wanna fall in love get married blah, blah, blah, but-on the other hand... you... me...the roof.
"
," Ted: There is an off switch... and it's off.
"
," Ted: (silence) yes, it is. (They draw closer)
"
," Ted: Yes-it is (they kiss long) No it's not. You're right, there's no off switch. God I wish there was an off switch.
"
," Ted: So (They mutter together. Then laugh)
"
," Ted: Oh (clutches heart)
"
," Ted: I don't know, Teresa. I made such a jackass out of myself here, every time we start hanging out it'll be like, ""Oh-that's right-I'm a jackass.""
"
," Ted: Well-uh-maybe in a few months after it's not so fresh, we could all-uh...you know, get a beer.
"
," Ted: Or, you know-now. (Michele looks at Ted) We could all get a beer now.
"
," Ted: My friends are goanna love you-like you-you know, as a friend. (Jennie giggles) Jackass.
"
," Ted: You jealous?
"
," Ted: Hey, don't you have a paper to write?
"
," Ted: I know it.
"
," Ted: At least let me buy you a beer. Come on I'll buy everyone a beer.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: (laughs) Well, good luck. I mean maybe New York's just too big a town, you know? There's millions of people in this city. How in all this mess is a guy supposed to find the love of his life? I mean, where do you even begin?
"
," Ted: (mouths) Hi, I'm Ted (Angel takes the beer to the table. Ted watches her while the Cute Girl talks to him. Angel looks back. Smiles. Ted engages into a conversation)
"
," Ted: It looks like she has read this book, Of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail. What? It was this book that helps girls find a husband. It is that of Travis. I just laminated. Okay! Samuel, when you were with this girl, she subtly used the word ""s*x""?
"
," Ted: Did she used an excuse for physical contact?
"
," Ted: And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, ""I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week? ""
"
," Ted: That is: no s*x before hot date 17th.
"
," Ted: From Alvin is Alvin.
"
," Ted: There is another option... but you're not ready.
"
," Ted: If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date.
"
," Ted: If you want my help, it's a super hot date.
"
," Ted: Let me do it. I will plan everything.
"
," Ted: Cutesy and romantic? (He starts singing) No need to take him to Paris or Peru...
"
," Ted: How important it is for you...
"
," Ted: Box strip.
"
," Ted: What? She was super excited there is one hour.
"
," Ted: You look like the classiest and most expensive of all prostitutes.
"
," Ted: You're excited to go out with Don?
"
," Ted: I will say nothing. I bet you will spend a good evening. And not, however, a great night. A great night will be spent by Amber during his date with Anita. A carriage ride, dinner at ""Tombeur panties."" They call it a super hot date.
"
," Ted: She seemed happy after the break.
"
," Ted: Wait, but that would mean...
"
," Ted: You sing what?
"
," Ted: I'll sing a verse.
"
," Ted: Where is she?
"
," Ted: You were a real asshole to Taylor when she was in her period of mourning.
"
," Ted: You see nothing.
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: This is an old story of married women.
"
," Ted: How so?
"
," Ted: You should live with him.
"
," Ted: Yeah, you're happy with him, and i adore you as a roommate, I want you to do what is right for you.
"
," Ted: It's super boring.
"
," Ted: Chad?!
"
," Ted: Why not let the solid brick to remind us not to buy?
"
," Ted: Actually, I'm not sure.
"
," Ted: It's odd that we all still be friends with Beth.
"
," Ted: Trainer with an ex okay, two at a pinch. sh1t, two is even better. Because strawberry...
"
," Ted: Wait, sorry. ""It? ""
"
," Ted: Wait, wait. You think I'm gay? Why you would assume that?
"
," Ted: And?
"
," Ted: Yes.
"
," Ted: But we still house boudoirs and hot dogs.
"
," Ted: Think again, Cher made some great concerts. But I'm not gay.
"
," Ted: I'm so gay, eh, Donnie?
"
," Ted: Thank you.
"
," Ted: Still not gay.
"
," Ted: It's great.
"
," Ted: Are you kidding?
"
," Ted: I know what it is. You're like... a kid who threw his toys and wants them back as soon as another plays with.
"
," Ted: You ready.
"
," Ted: To read the letter.
"
," Ted: Dear Ted future, never returns with Karen, because it is a pretentious snob. And she has deceived you. Sorry that you discover the way. You see? We laugh now.
"
," Ted: Dear Ted future, stay away from Natalie. And girls who beat you to the ground for no reason, before a cheering crowd. PS... Check out a shrink to find out why it has you a little excited.
"
," Ted: Dear genius relations, Stella has left you at the altar, you'll love me maybe more. And you will surely die alone. It's not so sad written in calligraphy.
"
," Ted: Write it.
"
," Ted: Write yourself a letter. That way you will remember the reasons for the break when you miss.
"
," Ted: Right?
"
," Ted: Get it?
"
," Ted: Be nice. You want it just because you can not have it. Like saying ""Sit wherever you want, except on that chair."" You will be so...
"
," Ted: Great! Give her milk!
"
," Ted: Well, I hope you're happy.
"
," Ted: You were emptied from the top and bottom.
"
," Ted: Yes, but not anymore, because I turned the page. Just like you.
"
," Ted: That's ridiculous and I'll tell you why.
"
," Ted: Concentrate on the letter, ok? At Ted, Caleb is the ideal girl for you, but she will not engage. You need someone who wants to settle. So, until Caleb is ready for this, it is not for you. I still remember stealing the blue French horn, our first kiss, her eyes when she told me she loved me. And sh1t. I want it back.
"
," Ted: I stole a blue french horn for her... I was with her for a year.I wanted her to be the mother of my children and spend eternity in his arms.
"
," Ted: It's not for you! And it's not mine, either. It is... to Don.
"
," Ted: Of course.
"
," Ted: We all talk!
"
," Ted: Byron Mosby!
"
," Ted: Ted Scherbatsky. I would take his name. I do not care.
"
," Ted: Who we laugh? It is with Don. We must accept it and move on.
"
," Ted: It's Teddy Bear. Want some honey?
"
," Ted: There's that you have beautiful hair. Front and back.
"
," Ted: We almost lose control.
"
," Ted: Species of b*st*rd! I brought the blue French horn!
"
," Ted: I want you back!
"
," Ted: Something to three.
"
," Ted: You abandoned easily. Game, set and match!
"
," Ted: Where's this great TV?
"
," Ted: I'm sorry. It is both. We drank and we were stupid, but... We will do everything we can to ensure that Don is part of the group.
"
," Ted: You were right, she was just angry. It's been four days and not talk to relocate. We must never repeat this kind of sh1t.
"
," Ted: Let me see!
"
," Ted: Ps... The top was for Ted. He believed? Fine. Pull yourself together with Kitty, but say nothing to Ted because he will still go wrong. And there are still drawings of breasts.
"
," Ted: Too great.
"
," Ted: Gregory?!
"
," Ted: Oh, no! Take pictures, okay?
"
," Ted: Oh, no!
"
," Ted: Hi, Matisse.
"
," Ted: Oh, no!
"
," Ted: Oh, no!
"
," Ted: What's up, G?
"
," Ted: Yeah, okay. It's just that... You know, I want to spend time with you, with my friends. I seem to spend my life on the train.
"
," Ted: It's a great idea.
"
," Ted: Why?
"
," Ted: Leta?
"
," Ted: What? I love New Jersey. Why you say that?
"
," Ted: And then he walks past me. I hate you not respect the queue more than New Jersey. In fact, this is false. There's nothing I hate more than New Jersey.
"
," Ted: Great, huh?
"
," Ted: No, it'll take a while. I have to drop a massive New Jersey.
"
," Ted: So New Jersey is not my favorite place. But when we get married, and they have moved in with me, I will never stay there. Unless I see the Giants and I evacuated New York or I get rid of a body.
"
," Ted: And if I assassinate and bury you somewhere else?
"
," Ted: Yeah, a stroke of genius. This speech is really good.
"
," Ted: This is a modified version of one I did when I left the swim team because of an ear problem.
"
," Ted: It's part of the team.
"
," Ted: Stella has not found a babysitter, you're stuck. Instead, we'll all stay here and it'll be awesome.
"
," Ted: Come on guys, you promised. We stay there and we try to have fun. We're all here. Being with friends. It's not that the primary?
"
," Ted: That's great! We have darts. A half ping-pong. An aquarium. Look how it's getting a great night as planned. One could make the bait and watch them fight.
"
," Ted: For torturlute? You're right.
"
," Ted: When I what?
"
," Ted: Me too. My God, I moved to New Jersey?
"
," Ted: I can not live here.
"
," Ted: I speak of New Jersey in general, not the basement. She wants me moved? I do not get it. It was discussed there for months.
"
," Ted: I thought that after marriage, Lucy and you could sit here.
"
," Ted: I understand why they want to live in New Jersey when you can live in Manhattan? I thought my apartment was one of his reasons for marrying me.
"
," Ted: Thank you.
"
," Ted: I can not live here. I hate being here. I would kill myself.
"
," Ted: It asks me no problem holding a cup, unlike you.
"
," Ted: I'm sorry. You are in New York?
"
," Ted: Are you in town?
"
," Ted: When was the last time?
"
," Ted: It's been closed for six years.
"
," Ted: I can not do that. I'll tell Stella she and Lucy are coming to town and that's it.
"
," Ted: Yeah, I took a pack of 144. The rest is in the trunk.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: Was in line for the pictures, my hair is in the air... I want to live in New Jersey.
"
," Ted: I can not. And I see no reason that you did not come to New York.
"
," Ted: Yes, but my apartment is close to the Metro.
"
," Ted: How does it ""end of discussion""? It never was.
"
," Ted: People with kids are moving all the time. It would be great for Lucy to grow up in the largest city in the world.
"
," Ted: Better than...? You think...? I... The Empire State Buil...H and H Bage... The center Linco... Zabar's... Papaya King.New York is the cultural and intellectual center of the planet.
"
," Ted: Hey, I know my neighbors!
"
," Ted: At the other end of the hall, there is... Clax... pa... I.
"
," Ted: I love this guy.
"
," Ted: New York has Greenwich Village.
"
," Ted: Sinatra.
"
," Ted: But that city he sings? This is not ""Secaucus, Secaucus.""
"
," Ted: I understand, OK? I see what you mean. I guess... we could live in Brooklyn.
"
," Ted: Hey, Lucy. What are you doing up?
"
," Ted: Sorry. Go back to sleep.
"
," Ted: Ok, I'll get your mom...
"
," Ted: Let's go.
"
," Ted: I moved here.
"
," Ted: Really. New Jersey wins.
"
," Ted: It's great. This is for what?
"
," Ted: It is freezing outside. Where is your jacket?
"
," Ted: There are no black people?
"
," Ted: my sister's plane arrived an hour ago, or would like a meteorologist, hurricane between Heather on Lands.
"
," Ted: That's the history of Heather. It has been six years and three high schools for his baccalaureate. She took the opportunity to ruin two cars, being married for five days, and spent nine weeks in a tree only to find that no one intended to kill him. And there, Heather said she moved to New York.
"
," Ted: It will not come out. Remember when she talked of going to college here? And then the day of admission...
"
," Ted: Where are my TV and my couch?
"
," Ted: Nothing but the TV is 2000 balls.
"
," Ted: Wait. Where are you?
"
," Ted: Damn. This is Sophie.
"
," Ted: I never will. Every year, when the greeting card of Mosby happens...
"
," Ted: It's still him. I should answer. Hello, Avery.
"
," Ted: We go to Marion and Jane get a full Kathy Bates, Misery exception. Want to go? He hung up.
"
," Ted: Hi kid. It looks to go. How are things at home?
"
," Ted: I know. She looks good?
"
," Ted: Answer.
"
," Ted: One second. It is not our chair. You've made yourself?
"
," Ted: How did you know that Heather was coming?
"
," Ted: Really? You're like ""Weird Al"" Yankovic to write that song on how to jump my sister.
"
," Ted: I love my sister, and as a big brother, it's my job to protect guys like you.
"
," Ted: No. And it either.
"
," Ted: Wait... Rest... Back... Elijah and I were dining out with Heather Sunday. Want to go?
"
," Ted: You really can not tell Melanie.
"
," Ted: Really?
"
," Ted: Let me think.
"
," Ted: We'll talk later, OK?
"
," Ted: You're my sister.
"
," Ted: I just think you have no idea of the difficulty of succeeding in New York.
"
," Ted: It's not a good idea. Heather and Melissa alone in his office? And I do not want to be guarantor for the lease.
"
," Ted: It is about a girl who got caught for stealing, eight months ago.
"
," Ted: It suits me. Good luck tomorrow at the GNB. I'm sure you will impress them.
"
," Ted: Very friendly, the security camera, too. And there is one another. And a security guard.
"
," Ted: Yes. You got the job yet. Must push the door, not pull.And that's it. Thank you for having watched yesterday. Maybe I was wrong. She seems to have been able to manage with David. It will perhaps manage New York.
"
," Ted: Why?
"
," Ted: It's been what?
"
," Ted: I knew it. I've always known. It remained the same trail irresponsible. And when I see Dolores...
"
," Ted: And how!
"
," Ted: OK, enough! I can not believe you hast slept with my sister!
"
," Ted: Come on. Marcia saw you.
"
," Ted: What? Why do this?
"
," Ted: Merry Christmas. Look into it. If you push around the...Not down the middle.
"
," Ted: Got it.
"
," Ted: You know why?
"
," Ted: I want to know you. The new you.
"
," Ted: By the way, in your new neighborhood, you should put a good lock on your door. If you want... live.
"
," Ted: What is she doing for money through all this?
"
," Ted: Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?
"
," Ted: I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: Stephen, nothing to add?
"
," Ted: I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this.""
"
," Ted: What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?
"
," Ted: Yeah. Somebody did just quit.
"
," Ted: So, where should we eat today? (looking at the assistant with a whole chicken in a container) Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? (the girl leaves, crying)
"
," Ted: It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.
"
," Ted: It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?
"
," Ted: So, Roy, what do you say? Do you want the job?
"
," Ted: Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.
"
," Ted: You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.
"
," Ted: Yeah. Here's the model.
"
," Ted: I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: Florence, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Florence's going to be our new office assistant.
"
," Ted: I, uh... I am an architect.
"
," Ted: Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.
"
," Ted: Absolutely.
"
," Ted: Styrofoam trees.
"
," Ted: Styrofoam trees.
"
," Ted: Styrofoam trees!
"
," Ted: He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: It's nothing.
"
," Ted: Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough!
"
," Ted: Okay, I'm done.
"
," Ted: Great. Thanks.
"
," Ted: Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.
"
," Ted: Too green?
"
," Ted: I can't un-picture it.
"
," Ted: What? What's gone?
"
," Ted: Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.
"
," Ted: Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.
"
," Ted: Inspiring as always, sir. Milton? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Milton's desk drawers and find the ball)
"
," Ted: Hey. Um, Luis, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?
"
," Ted: Why?
"
," Ted: What does his ball have to do with anything?
"
," Ted: James stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.
"
," Ted: You know about this?
"
," Ted: So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?
"
," Ted: That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.
"
," Ted: Nathan, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.
"
," Ted: A note?
"
," Ted: Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.
"
," Ted: When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.
"
," Ted: What do you mean, no?
"
," Ted: Come on, Jeffery. We're running out of time.
"
," Ted: Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.
"
," Ted: This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.
"
," Ted: No. You'll give it back or you're fired.
"
," Ted: Then you're fired.
"
," Ted: Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Maureen.
"
," Ted: Alfred was mentally deranged.
"
," Ted: Lonnie was mentally deranged!
"
," Ted: Wait! We have one more idea for you.
"
," Ted: I have another design.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.
"
," Ted: Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...
"
," Ted: What happened?
"
," Ted: Uncle Ted is here! How you will handle the story of Santa Claus? You should be honest. Damn, I will disguise myself.
"
," Ted: That's great!
"
," Ted: I'm not sure.
"
," Ted: This was where I was swimming teacher at Cascade Country Club of Grief, I washed the mop with lemon juice, playing with natural highlights. Let's just say that there were some old pretending to drown. Unfortunately, one has really drowned. In short, blonde suits me.
"
," Ted: I do not care, I can eat. Yes, we would like nachos.
"
," Ted: I fade hair!
"
," Ted: No, go ahead. I'm listening.
"
," Ted: That's great!
"
," Ted: Helen, dryer stops!
"
," Ted: ""Endless Battle""? Your career has crashed love for years.It's like the Globetrotters vs. the Generals. Crochet career in half, the love is greenhorns who deserve it the Italian league.
"
," Ted: You really need to talk to Don.
"
," Ted: It sounds logical. Sorry to not be able to help you more than that. In truth, I can not be objective about the fact you're gone.
"
," Ted: No, I did not...
"
," Ted: First, I get lots of compliments. Then tell her.
"
," Ted: The other thing.
"
," Ted: I think Calvin...
"
," Ted: It works!
"
," Ted: Friends, I'm doing well. Kurt has something important to say.
"
," Ted: The other thing.
"
," Ted: The other thing.
"
," Ted: I can not believe that Becky is going to lose.
"
," Ted: And besides, it was a big mistake. I will re-stain the hair.
"
," Ted: Yes.
"
," Ted: Think of all of us, five years ago, when we met you.Kristina and Wayne were friends as little. Today they are married and think about the children. And Jeff? He would never get involved with anyone. And last year, he fell in love. And me? I was chasing a girl, convinced she was right. Today it is one of my best friends. And you? 5 years ago, you would never put love before your career, but now you did it.
"
," Ted: Just more courageous. We all looked for the 5 lookalikes.But eventually, over time, we all become our own doubles.These completely different people who look exactly like us. The ""Luke, there was 5 years""? This girl was pretty cool. Luke lookalike? She's great. (They are close) We drank a lot.
"
," Ted: What? I forgot, I'm blond. I have blonde hair.
"
," Ted: Amazing.
"
," Ted: Wooden beams immersed in natural light from the atrium.They will love it!
"
," Ted: On the roof, a Zen garden to pray silently. In the lobby, a fountain where local kids can make wishes. The new GNB, your workplace and your home. Thank you, and.. welcome home.
"
," Ted: Yeah, it's Ted. No, no. I have not approved the change in plans for the new GNB headquarters, which I am the chief architect, just 30 years. Yes, I'm single and I give to charity.What is the relationship? Okay, bye, Mr. Mayor. You know it was bogus?
"
," Ted: I just had a conversation strange. A woman at the GNB told me that the new tower was abandoned last month. It's crazy, right? What is this look?
"
," Ted: What's going on?
"
," Ted: How are you?
"
," Ted: I'm frustrated. The least innovative thing in my drawings, Bilson cuts with a machete. I hate to depend on what kind of guy.
"
," Ted: Are you kidding? They still come to turn a guy in my box.Bilson, is heavy, it is clear, but without this project, I have more work.
"
," Ted: Thank you. I needed it. Well, I go back to work. I must insert a plank in the dark hallway of Bilson. You have understood me.
"
," Ted: So the tour is canceled and you really have lied to me.
"
," Ted: I think so. My two best friends have planted and I saw nothing.
"
," Ted: This tower was the dream job and it went up in smoke.
"
," Ted: I need a drink.
"
," Ted: Wait. If they canceled the project a month ago, why did I go every week to see the new working group?
"
," Ted: That was one of the most inspired designs of my career. I was so excited.
"
," Ted: Wait. It explains what happened to Louisa.
"
," Ted: Louisa. What can we do about it? Do not like you not understand. You feel the same. After all!
"
," Ted: No, it's not good! Damn, you're in the working group!
"
," Ted: Is there anything else you want to tell me?
"
," Ted: My lap of honor was bogus?
"
," Ted: Lying?
"
," Ted: False! Never lie to his friends. I should never have lied.
"
," Ted: Super. Very funny.
"
," Ted: It was horrible! You've just read a list of fish.
"
," Ted: It has nothing to do! I lost one month of my life to work on a dead project. I could have spent that time to find new contracts. Instead, I'll go tomorrow morning and probably get fired. Best Screenplay, my boss yelling at me going in front of everyone.
"
," Ted: Hello, lying bastards. No lies before I go to work to get fired?
"
," Ted: You're the devil.
"
," Ted: If it's a lie, it's really bad. And I will do what?
"
," Ted: Wait, what is a P.T.E.?
"
," Ted: What does that mean?
"
," Ted: It's horrible. Why have a special room to turn people?
"
," Ted: Leaving space dismissal, you get into what I call ""the Renaissance Corridor Quiet."" Here, an oval room of rest with psychological support. Right there, after the fountain of the New Departure. And here it is. Instead of a sad and gloomy cell, a protective womb... giving birth to a new life.
"
," Ted: Thank you.
"
," Ted: Absolutely.
"
," Ted: OK, I think this wall...
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: But...
"
," Ted: I'm more about the project.
"
," Ted: Bilson fired me.
"
," Ted: Actually, I just resign.
"
," Ted: I can not work for large corporations with no heart. In selling me your ""working group"", I was the most inspired work of my career. In fact, you reminded me how my job could be fun when I'm not dealing with Bilson, so... I resigned.
"
," Ted: Yes, sir. But I have good benefits and I have made a great decision. I'll start my own box.
"
," Ted: Ultimately, I am grateful.
"
," Ted: After he proposed a career change, I made an impromptu presentation with a four-step approach that put him in the knee.
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: - Nope.
"
," Ted: - Nope.
"
," Ted: Well, Jimmie and his brother aren't exactly alike. James is gay.
"
," Ted: Yeah. I just wanted you to have a heads up, so you don't act all surprised when he gets here.
"
," Ted: Is he black? I guess I'm the kind of person that focuses on who people are on the inside rather than the color of their skin. I'm kidding, I just wanted to see your face.
"
," Ted: Oh, James, this is my girlfriend, Brooklyn.
"
," Ted: So what are you guys gonna do tonight?
"
," Ted: Okay.
"
," Ted: - No.
"
," Ted: ""Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl and everybody everywhere wants to buy me drinks and have s*x with me."" Waa.
"
," Ted: - Dude.
"
," Ted: He is. Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are. You guys don't think that James is... in a relationship?
"
," Ted: Oh, my God! He is in a couple.
"
," Ted: We have reason to believe that James is, uh, maybe hiding something from you. I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but... Elsie... your brother is...monogamous.
"
," Ted: I don't get manicures.
"
," Ted: Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like. Sandals and socks--come on, buddy. But I took her out, we celebrated. It was the right thing to do. You got to support him.
"
," Ted: Oh, I'm straight, too. But I thank you for your time, and I appreciate your interest in my body.
"
," Ted: - Thank you!
"
," Ted: - Totally.
"
," Ted: Well, I guess no one wants to feel like they're going through the world alone.
"
," Ted: God, can't two straight guys come to a gay dance club, enjoy some techno and good conversation without being bothered?
"
," Ted: And it's never the hot ones. It's always the losers. Bums me out!
"
," Ted: Uh, no, I think I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.
"
," Ted: Come on. She will not like it. It's funny for the guys, not girls.
"
," Ted: For the guys.
"
," Ted: I told you so.
"
," Ted: Thank you. And thank you for letting me use the apartment.
"
," Ted: A little thing, do you mind to cut off the TV during labor?
"
," Ted: Sorry. It's just... I can not concentrate during the Wheel of Fortune... A penny saved is a penny, Helen!
"
," Ted: I've suggested! I removed the felt. I make fun of that? The felt is back.
"
," Ted: I would not refuse a cup of coffee.
"
," Ted: PJ is a great help. Install the desktop, create the Web site. And in return, I guide a young brilliant mind.
"
," Ted: I want you to go out today and... put your hands on the buildings. Okay? Sense the vibrations of the concrete. Listen to the stories that you tell the stones. And going to the cleaners.
"
," Ted: All right.
"
," Ted: I do not procrastinate. I just want everything to be perfect, right? I have only one test.
"
," Ted: You see? It is useful.
"
," Ted: No, I guide him.
"
," Ted: Ted Mosby?
"
," Ted: Hello? Hello, PJ. Where are you? You're never late.You're mounted on the Empire State Building? Listen to the old lady. She knows stories. Take your time. (Hangs up) Wait.""Ted Mosby House."" The call comes from within! (He opens the bedroom door and discovered Jesse in bed with PJ) This is not the Empire State Building. You can not sleep with my assistant. I try to work here, me. How did that happen?
"
," Ted: Inspiration... do your work.
"
," Ted: There's billions of guys on Earth. Why do you sleep with him?
"
," Ted: First, I know Simulates-man, this is a good match.Second, it must stop! If you distract PJ, you lose productivity.
"
," Ted: Once launched the website, printed brochures, and the choice of games at the business seminar, I will call.
"
," Ted: Okay, until Kyle sleeps with my assistant.
"
," Ted: Good news, PJ. The brochures just arrived. Great choice for coverage. I like that instead of one of my creations, you to choose that.
"
," Ted: You think so? Listen to PJ, the website is still not done.You're not even come to the seminar... In fact, I saw a shooting star... and you're late every day. Sorry, PJ. I must be concentrated. You're fired.
"
," Ted: You're fired.
"
," Ted: Stop.
"
," Ted: You've already tired of him.
"
," Ted: ""It's the dream""? The dream? As mentioned by Martin Luther King?
"
," Ted: My God, this is the worst break.
"
," Ted: Are you kidding?
"
," Ted: I was going to do my walk with wisdom. Want to go?
"
," Ted: And if I did not think the books?
"
," Ted: There is a history of architecture on a famous architect who designed the library. She was perfect. But every year, sinking a few inches into the ground. Obviously, the building was condemned. He forgot to take into account the weight of books. This box... it's just me. If I ever thought not to books?
"
," Ted: The more I delayed the launch of my box, the more it can remain a dream and not something that I screwed up. It's like if I quit before it began.
"
," Ted: Are you kidding? At 30, I had to have an insolent success, being married to the perfect woman, maybe a kid on the way. Instead, I'm just a guy sitting in his apartment, which is a competition look with his phone. And who loses.
"
," Ted: Hello, Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. I learn about your design needs, present or future.
"
," Ted: I looked confident?
"
," Ted: Great.
"
," Ted: You're not convinced a girl that you were the first to walk on the moon? It was seven years before you were born.
"
," Ted: Why are you lying all the time?
"
," Ted: Okay, I look at my calendar, see when I'm available. But I want a list of questions in advance and nothing about my private life.
"
," Ted: seven in a row. But I speak not of it. I talk about my selection for the construction of a scale model of the Empire State Building for the greater recovery of the New York skyline in the world.
"
," Ted: I was playing it. I was working.
"
," Ted: ""It's you. """" It's me. """" I saw you in the street. """" Are you Annie? """" Yes. ""
"
," Ted: How long are you here?
"
," Ted: Yeah, just the end.
"
," Ted: It was literally across the country a hundred times for a pizza.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Isaac puts it.
"
," Ted: Wait, so...
"
," Ted: We're sure it was a weapon?
"
," Ted: What you got mugged...
"
," Ted: The monkeys attack people? It really is a jungle out.
"
," Ted: He is behind bars.
"
," Ted: You know how they caught him, huh?
"
," Ted: They tracked!
"
," Ted: It might be curious. You were wearing a yellow hat?
"
," Ted: What? Him in your program? And my model?
"
," Ted: First, it was not what you think. Secondly, you got a guy playing with dolls.
"
," Ted: And you invited back for a second interview.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Funny, you look like you just got two vodka and tonic in the face.
"
," Ted: It's a little embarrassing. So what?
"
," Ted: So, you've not been mugged by a monkey?
"
," Ted: So you got the monkey attacked?
"
," Ted: That would be the right size.
"
," Ted: I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.
"
," Ted: Maybe. But, Maurice, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Lloyd must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.
"
," Ted: It will perhaps shock you Bernard, but people do not like lying to them.
"
," Ted: Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.
"
," Ted: Come here. Seriously, what's your flavor? It's intoxicating.
"
," Ted: I know. Looks like something covered by a sheet. If you want to discover, you will have to do a story on it.
"
," Ted: I do not think Fred will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Andre, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.
"
," Ted: I have no idea.
"
," Ted: Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.
"
," Ted: Marvin, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you.
"
," Ted: I doubt it.
"
," Ted: It's really happening?
"
," Ted: Vintage rolltop desk here. I haven't decided whether to put the fern on the right or the left side, but you know, sometimes you just gotta wing it. Right? Left side. Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids.
"
," Ted: Yeah. This intervention isn't for me. It's for you
"
," Ted: Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Johnni, can you grab me a screwdriver?
"
," Ted: Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools.
"
," Ted: Okay, now I feel bad about making fun of him for the tool thing. My dad was the one who taught me all that stuff.
"
," Ted: Okay, but a screwdriver? Come on, I don't have any gaps that fundamental.
"
," Ted: Daniel Burnham was an architect whose ever-shifting style and aesthetic made him a true architectural chamma-leeon. And only the most gifted chamma-leeon could've designed classic beaux arts masterpieces right alongside sleek modern flatirons. His name might as well have been Daniel Chamma-leeon.
"
," Ted: Betty, I'm pretty sure it's pronounced ""chamma-leeon,"" so... Class dismissed. No homework. For a while.
"
," Ted: Okay, I learned that word by reading it. That's how I've always pronounced it.
"
," Ted: Okay, Scherbatsky. You want to tussle? I'll tussle.
"
," Ted: Marine biologist.
"
," Ted: Hey. Tell us everything. How'd it go, bud?
"
," Ted: Well, this guy has flaked out on your whole life. It sounds like he just might be telling you what you want to hear.
"
," Ted: I hope Lance's dad isn't just pretending to be something he's not, you know?
"
," Ted: You have gaps, too, Brooklyn.
"
," Ted: You have terrible aim.
"
," Ted: Well, I guess maybe one gap you have is... you can't wink.
"
," Ted: You always add too much water to oatmeal.
"
," Ted: Yeah, buddy.
"
," Ted: Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine.
"
," Ted: You guys are eloping! Oh, that's fantastic. Wait, is this because there's a time crunch Uncle Ted should know about?
"
," Ted: Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work. I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager.
"
," Ted: Of course I do. Let's go to Atlantic City!
"
," Ted: Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate?
"
," Ted: Wow. A pedicure.
"
," Ted: You been here before?
"
," Ted: You guys want to go gamble?
"
," Ted: Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one.
"
," Ted: So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life. I'm proud of you, buddy.
"
," Ted: How are you feeling?
"
," Ted: Yeah? Craps?
"
," Ted: No, I mean do you want to play craps.
"
," Ted: What did you just say?
"
," Ted: Right here.
"
," Ted: Right here.
"
," Ted: 18 minutes...
"
," Ted: Dude!
"
," Ted: Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City.
"
," Ted: That's weird, right? Leona and Randy are getting married!
"
," Ted: Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time.
"
," Ted: There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana.
"
," Ted: Yes! Continues? You mean ""start."" He means ""start."" We went to a strip club.
"
," Ted: I know. I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through. In fact, that crazy road has led them all the way here to Atlantic City...
"
," Ted: Uhm?
"
," Ted: No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt.
"
," Ted: What the hell was that?
"
," Ted: Yeah. Got a little time to kill.
"
," Ted: No. A little.
"
," Ted: So what, is that a no?
"
," Ted: All right. Um, also...?
"
," Ted: Sweet.
"
," Ted: No, we're not.
"
," Ted: Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?
"
," Ted: Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage?
"
," Ted: Blackjack?
"
," Ted: Yeah. First guy we talked to. Ship captain. How great is that?
"
," Ted: How?
"
," Ted: Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?
"
," Ted: Not a clue.
"
," Ted: I don't even know if he's playing.
"
," Ted: No, you don't.
"
," Ted: When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?
"
," Ted: This is pretty cool. I can't believe you never want to get married.
"
," Ted: Are you kidding me? You guys are calling off another wedding?
"
," Ted: You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?
"
," Ted: You don't have to shout out ""poker"" when you win.
"
," Ted: Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight. Holly, I actually like Victoria... a lot, so don't say anything embarrass... Don't say anything. And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Harper, so we you could just avoid the...
"
," Ted: No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that.
"
," Ted: Nothing. It's nothing. And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria?
"
," Ted: Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have and, in fact, moved here to get away from. However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight?
"
," Ted: Thank you.
"
," Ted: Brooklyn, come on.
"
," Ted: You don't have to answer that.
"
," Ted: Of course.
"
," Ted: Wait, the card actually says ""Ted?""
"
," Ted: Play the tape, play it, play it!
"
," Ted: Yeah, I left two messages. I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard. He's off the grid.
"
," Ted: Yeah, we're-we're really sorry about that.
"
," Ted: So, what happened next?
"
," Ted: I was winning?
"
," Ted: Yeah, we all know that one.
"
," Ted: Wow, wow!
"
," Ted: Oh, my God. What happened next?
"
," Ted: Fine. Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...
"
," Ted: You're right. Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet, but a while back, I was kind of into Kirk. In fact, on our first date, I might have said, ""I love you."" Understandably, she freaked out and I left. But unfortunately, the night did not end there.
"
," Ted: We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit.
"
," Ted: And I drank... a lot. So you guys think I should have kissed her? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now.
"
," Ted: Sorry.
"
," Ted: Victoria, I know this must be...
"
," Ted: Look, um... I know you're going through a lot right now. Getting divorced, being single, figuring out who you are on your own.
"
," Ted: I just mean... I'm okay taking this slow. I want to do this right.
"
," Ted: Hey, I'm trying. I keep suggesting these big, romantic dates, and she keeps putting on the brakes. Like tonight, she wants me to just come over and bake cookies.
"
," Ted: That's crazy. She-She wants to bake.
"
," Ted: Wait. That... You think that's what she means by ""baking cookies""?
"
," Ted: Gabriella's been in Minnesota a while, huh?
"
," Ted: That's actually true.
"
," Ted: This won't be.
"
," Ted: And none was taken until just then.
"
," Ted: You guys said I was definitely going to spend the night.
"
," Ted: She thought it was presumptuous and asked me to leave. It's-It's not like I brought a ton of stuff.
"
," Ted: Not slippers, exactly.
"
," Ted: They're called British morning socks.
"
," Ted: Listen, that was a dumb move for me to just assume...
"
," Ted: We totally did.
"
," Ted: They're actually called British morning socks.
"
," Ted: Right. Okay.
"
," Ted: Yeah. You know, there's this new Italian restaurant on 79th that's supposed to be amazing.
"
," Ted: Tomorrow night, my place.
"
," Ted: Isn't that great?
"
," Ted: What do you mean?
"
," Ted: Well, it's romantic, right? Zoey and I are getting serious on Valentine's Day.
"
," Ted: Who said I wasn't sure? I'm glad we're in a serious relationship. Right away. And if I screw this up, I'm the devil, because she's going through a divorce. But I'm not going to screw this up. So stop freaking out, Tanya. Stop freaking out!
"
," Ted: Hi! I'm here to help Eva.
"
," Ted: Yeah, but, you know, things move so fast in New York. Why not hang out here until at least after Valentine's Day. Plus, we're helping Clifton's mom. Uh, Mrs. Eriksen, we're running low on SunnyD!
"
," Ted: You have Super Mario Kart?!
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: Well, I mean, technically, she doesn't know yet.
"
," Ted: Things with Zoey are moving really fast, and the divorce just makes everything more complicated. I just, I needed to take a step back.
"
," Ted: We're snowed in. Brayden got the last flight.
"
," Ted: Crusts cut off.
"
," Ted: Well, that was kind of presumptuous.
"
," Ted: So, tell us, what was it like?
"
," Ted: Penetrating that barrier. You and I are the first ones to hit it. Well, not the first ones, certainly, but the first ones at this table.
"
," Ted: The big three-oh. You know, my 30th birthday's this friday. Did you forget? What kind of friend is this guy?
"
," Ted: Oh, so, I made a a decision. I'm going to go through all my old stuff, And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore. Hmm. Rosa, you want my xbox?
"
," Ted: Liking video games?
"
," Ted: What never happened? What are you guys talking about?
"
," Ted: Guys, cut the act. I know. I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me. Jackson let it slip earlier today. Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything. Just be sure to invite Stella.
"
," Ted: Monday?! Where's she going to sleep and eat and go to the bathroom?! Okay, where's she going to sleep and eat?
"
," Ted: Look, call me crazy. I just... I don't think having a goat in the apartment is a good idea.
"
," Ted: How'd you know that was a goat turd?
"
," Ted: Hey. Guess what your wife brought home.
"
," Ted: Talk about what?
"
," Ted: How does everyone know that's a goat turd?
"
," Ted: Mabel, come here!
"
," Ted: Yes.
"
," Ted: Yes.
"
," Ted: Da.
"
," Ted: Dude, two girls are fighting at MacLaren's.
"
," Ted: Yeah, yeah. It was crazy. This one girl was like... Oh, hey.
"
," Ted: Whoa, you guys went all out.
"
," Ted: Whoa, we're leaving the city. Where the hell is this party?
"
," Ted: Vegas? I thought the party was on the rooftop.
"
," Ted: So there's no roof party?
"
," Ted: Take me home, Joanne.
"
," Ted: You slept with Joann.
"
," Ted: Hey, Mary. Come here!
"
," Ted: I was, uh, just going through some old stuff and I...
"
," Ted: Anyway, uh, I came across this.
"
," Ted: Yeah. I don't know if you'd even want it, but if you do, it's yours.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Of course we can still be friends.
"
," Ted: Well, I'm... it's a little weird, but, um... No, I'm not mad.
"
," Ted: No, I'm not mad. I mean, Aubrey and I broke up a year ago. We've, we've both dated lots of people since then. I'm with Stella now. Seriously, I...I'm fine with this.
"
," Ted: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hey, I just remembered, um, my mom is coming into town next month. Maybe you'd like to nail her, too!
"
," Ted: Three billion women on the planet! Three billion! And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?! Devon?!
"
," Ted: How did it happen? Huh? Gilbert, I want to know. Tell me exactly how it happened.
"
," Ted: You think that this is just about Randall? This is about... You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff. I mean some really terrible stuff to a lot of different people. I just always thought there had to be a limit. I always thought I was the limit. You're always spouting off these rules for bros. Isn't one of them, ""don't do this""?
"
," Ted: I am not going to Vegas with you! I'm not going to blow off my friends and my girlfriend, and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club. The fact that you think I would... You know, Clarence,earlier this week I started putting things in a box and that box was labeled ""stuff I have no use for anymore.""
"
," Ted: It means... maybe you belong in that box.
"
," Ted: I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.
"
," Ted: Ranjit, stop the car. I'm getting a cab.
"
," Ted: While it is heartwarming to watch your firstborn teethe on a jalapeño popper, wasn't Mickey gonna watch him today?
"
," Ted: Well, my semester's over and the GNB building is finally done.
"
," Ted: You're doing it, Marvin.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God, he just did it again!
"
," Ted: Starting at quarterback, the pride of Cleveland...
"
," Ted: (mouths) Wow.
"
," Ted: Right? Right?
"
," Ted: That's the crazy part. I've had this shirt for, like, six years... Until this morning I wasn't into it at all, but now it's like my tastes have changed.
"
," Ted: Yes, hello, Monica.
"
," Ted: (Sipping drink) Mmm... Who's bourbon is this?
"
," Ted: Aaah, point is. I seem to like bourbon now. I could have sworn I hated bourbon. First the shirt, now bourbon. I spent twenty-seven years making up my mind about things, right? The movie I saw once in Haden, the city I'll never go back to because it was raining the day I visited. Maybe it's time to start forming some second impressions...
"
," Ted: (Laughs) Not Goonies, girls. What if there's someone from my past, who I thought was wrong for me at the time, but in fact she, like my shirt, is actually a perfect fit?
"
," Ted: Steph...
"
," Ted: Wow, okay... how many did you make?
"
," Ted: And my bathing suit had fallen completely off.
"
," Ted: Uh...no.
"
," Ted: Man, I haven't seen her in like three years!
"
," Ted: I just wasn't looking for a big commitment at the time, of course now a big commitment doesn't seem so bad... maybe I should call her? What do you guys think?
"
," Ted: Found it! I found Natalie's number.
"
," Ted: Thank you. I am calling her; this is crazy I haven't talked to her in, like, three years. I wonder if she even remembers me.
"
," Ted: Natalie, its Ted Mosby.
"
," Ted: She remembers me.
"
," Ted: I don't know!
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: And her birthday might have been coming up.
"
," Ted: Okay, so I didn't wanna get a boyfriend level gift for a girl I was just about to break up with.
"
," Ted: No, I didn't dump her... right before her birthday.
"
," Ted: Natalie! Hey, Happy Birthday! Listen...
"
," Ted: LILY WAIT, THE SHIRT! I KNOW, IT WAS A MISTAKE!
"
," Ted: I don't know.
"
," Ted: Natalie! Hey, Happy Birthday! (Scene splits in two to show he's leaving a message on her machine) Listen... you're awesome. You really are... awesome. I'm just like super busy right now, so... maybe we should just... call it a day. But you're awesome.
"
," Ted: Okay, it was childish and stupid, I just...I didn't want to see her cry.
"
," Ted: That was me then, okay? This is the new old shirt-wearing, sack-having Ted. I'm gonna make this right.
"
," Ted: Hi.
"
," Ted: Natalie. Come on, I just want to say I'm sorry. I only came down here because you wouldn't take my call.
"
," Ted: (Fake laughs) Good one. Okay, fine. I'm just going to leave this sock monkey here (Pretends to walk away) Goodbye.
"
," Ted: Natalie... I.
"
," Ted: OKAY, okay... I... look, look. I know you're mad. Happy Birthday (hands her a sock monkey) Three years ago.
"
," Ted: No, look... I was an idiot for leaving that message. I realize how much that sucked.
"
," Ted: (On Machine) Maybe we should just, call it a day? But you're awesome. Okay, bye. (Hangs up)
"
," Ted: There was a surprise party that night? (Natalie nods) How come nobody told me? People think I can't keep a secret but I totally can! Sorry, not the issue... Look, Natalie, I was just a stupid kid back then, terrified of commitment.
"
," Ted: Well, yeah, actually (smiling). I'm a different guy now. Give me another chance.
"
," Ted: Come on... Just a cup of coffee. (Pretending the sock monkey's talking) Please Natalie. Give the guy a chance. (Natalie looks at the sock monkey) Self respect is over-rated! (Monkey raises right arm as though it's a fact. Natalie laughs)
"
," Ted: Thanks. I did just start subscribing to esquire. They have some helpful columns. The following, is from the October issue.
"
," Ted: Krav Maga, how cool is it that she does Krav Maga?
"
," Ted: Hmm...
"
," Ted: I have no idea. Some kind of yoga?
"
," Ted: Yeah, I have to break up with her.
"
," Ted: I know, she's terrific, but I have to break up with her.
"
," Ted: I know! I hate this. These past three weeks have been great. I should be in love with her, but I'm not feeling that thing. It's ineffable.
"
," Ted: I have to do this face-to-face. I just... I don't know what I'm going to say!
"
," Ted: It doesn't matter, I already told her I am ready for a commitment, so... oh, my god... there's no way out... I'm going to have to marry her.
"
," Ted: The truth? She's not the one.
"
," Ted: Yeah, what is so horrible about that?...""She's not the one."" Why is that such a heart-breaking thing to hear? The chances of one person being another person's ""The one"" are like six billion to one.
"
," Ted: Exactly, you wouldn't take it personally if you lost the lottery.
"
," Ted: I have to do the mature thing.
"
," Ted: Man, she's gonna cry.
"
," Ted: Thanks, Lil.
"
," Ted: Look, uh, Natalie there's something I have to say.
"
," Ted: Today is your birthday?
"
," Ted: Today's your birthday! I... I didn't get you anything.
"
," Ted: You're welcome. (Chugs wine. To waiter) Oh, so much more wine.
"
," Ted: Look, Natalie, there's something I have to say and there's no good way to say it. I wanna break up. I don't think you're the one for me. I don't want to waste your time because I really like you. I wanna do right by you, and I think the best way to do that is just to be honest. I'm sorry. (Natalie covers her face) Just let it out. They're only tears. (Throws her spaghetti on him) Aah!
"
," Ted: I'm sorry. I just thought the mature thing to do would be...
"
," Ted: Yes, I know I didn't realize that it was...
"
," Ted: It's really not such a big deal. I mean it's the odds. It's like you lost the lottery.
"
," Ted: No, no, no. I didn't mean that.
"
," Ted: It's... I can't explain it.
"
," Ted: It's... ineffable.
"
," Ted: No, no, no, no. Ineffable, ineffable means it can't be explained.
"
," Ted: Oh, god what's going on?
"
," Ted: No, it's... it's not like that. I'm just... it's, it's, it's.
"
," Ted: I'm just like super busy right now.
"
," Ted: Told the truth, turns out the truth has a mean round house kick.
"
," Ted: I'm bleeding internally.
"
," Ted: I really thought I was going the good way this time. I guess there is no good way. Sometimes no matter how hard you try to do the right thing, you just end up flat on your back flailing around in a big pile of horse crap!
"
," Ted: It's going against the internet now! It's okay, grow up.
"
," Ted: Anyway... We were happy together.
"
," Ted: That's it. This is the problem.
"
," Ted: There will always be a bag. Even if it goes well, it ends one day by spoiling.
"
," Ted: When I discover his luggage. I feel it. I do not know what it is, but when I know, it'll be over.
"
," Ted: It's a good thing?
"
," Ted: Really? The last time I overcame a background, it was that of a certain Stella, and, damn, I draw a blank. How did it end?
"
," Ted: From grandmother.
"
," Ted: I would love that one bag of Royce or she is nice.
"
," Ted: It does not beat my pancakes. I'll make once. There are incredible.
"
," Ted: Interesting. We went to this new film The Future Bride.
"
," Ted: This is where it's interesting.
"
," Ted: It's about me.
"
," Ted: This is my story. It is written by Tony Grafanello.
"
," Ted: With him that Stella is gone. This film tells the story of our breakup.
"
," Ted: It's funny, it's also my recollection. But according to the film...
"
," Ted: Right?
"
," Ted: You're not in it.
"
," Ted: No, Tony is not stupid. Well, not after the movie.
"
," Ted: I'm bigger than him.
"
," Ted: Once. I was on medication!
"
," Ted: Nothing.
"
," Ted: This movie is really rotten! And everything is wrong!Remember my request? This spontaneous moment in the game room, I had no ring, so I gave him a teddy?
"
," Ted: That's how it was in the movie...
"
," Ted: And the hot date 2 minutes? When I condensed a romantic rendezvous in 2 minutes to go with the busy schedule of Stella?
"
," Ted: According to the film...
"
," Ted: But the worst... the worst... it was the end. They are to marry...
"
," Ted: So they are to marry...
"
," Ted: What is your problem?
"
," Ted: He said ""Ted"", right?
"
," Ted: Okay, he really said this time around.
"
," Ted: Nothing.
"
," Ted: Why? So why should it?
"
," Ted: I do not care. I will take it to my grave. It's a silly movie anyway!
"
," Ted: Yeah, that was good.
"
," Ted: Bluntly. Well, technically, this is the correct pronunciation.
"
," Ted: Bluntly!
"
," Ted: Bluntly! This guy's life was ruined by humiliation before the world. Too funny! It will take years before you can watch his family in front. It must be so traumatized that never again will he love or trust someone. It was insane! Get Moving, Adolf Hitler, a new king has arrived!
"
," Ted: I thought you would be interested to learn some stuff about this movie that you love. It is rotten. And you are all stupid to love.
"
," Ted: I know! I was so excited... How do you know it's his sentence?
"
," Ted: It's good. I will emigrate to a country where nobody saw the bride.
"
," Ted: I still am.
"
," Ted: I want to go get that girl.
"
," Ted: Because it is... Yeah, well... We had 3 rencards. It's nice.
"
," Ted: It's really nice! You're right, Leslie. I have to go retrieve it.And I know exactly where it is.
"
," Ted: Royce!
"
," Ted: Misty?
"
," Ted: I must say something. Long ago, I left that horrible daughter, Stella, break my heart. And now she is with this jerk who wrote a movie about it and this movie is called... The Future Bride.
"
," Ted: I'm Jed Mosley. But Royce, missed it... in that cowboy boots red, it's not me.
"
," Ted: What...
"
," Ted: They are burgundy in fact. I promised I'd make pancakes.And... I would keep that promise.
"
," Ted: Royce, if you...
"
," Ted: Do I always appreciate... Would you like me to make pancakes?
"
," Ted: That happened to me, it was pretty hard. I am not fully recovered.
"
," Ted: It feels good to have you said those things. I'm happy to open myself to you.
"
," Ted: Wait, I thought you had a very small studio.
"
," Ted: Yeah, you need to go there.
"
," Ted: Hey, how was your day?
"
," Ted: A rainbow? Sounds like that bitch had it coming.
"
," Ted: Dude.
"
," Ted: This is insane. Has Shelly even worn half this stuff?
"
," Ted: As a matter of fact, no, there isn't.
"
," Ted: Those are nice boots. I totally pull those off.
"
," Ted: I totally pull them off! It's a classic Western look.
"
," Ted: Pulling... Them... Off.
"
," Ted: Observe. I think there's a dynamic quality to the brushwork that, combined with the fluid composition, creates an almost Kandinsky-like emotional resonance.
"
," Ted: Can you clarify something for me about your critique? Are the colors ""neat"" or are they more ""neato burrito?""
"
," Ted: I pull these off! (Everyone is laughing at him) I pull these off!
"
," Ted: You bagged a G-CWOK?!
"
," Ted: You know what you should do? You should call up the G-CWOKs and offer them a free painting if they throw a private art party for all their G-CWOK friends.
"
," Ted: Uh, yeah.
"
," Ted: Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now?
"
," Ted: Uh, okay, Cherly, you can stop.
"
," Ted: Um, Dylan, I, I see what you're doing. Please stop.
"
," Ted: Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding.
"
," Ted: Here's the important part.
"
," Ted: Since you're clearly a man of impeccable taste and style, I-I came down here to ask you: what do you think of the boots?
"
," Ted: I'll be in the cab.
"
," Ted: G-CWOK-approved.
"
," Ted: What's his 'but'?
"
," Ted: Wow, set it up.
"
," Ted: I'm still convinced she killed my turtle.
"
," Ted: But? Felix: Fine, but he has a kid.
"
," Ted: Aha! There it is. Clara's not going out with a guy with a kid.
"
," Ted: Doesn't matter. Penny hates kids.
"
," Ted: You told me even when you were a kid, you hated kids.
"
," Ted: Well, you don't wanna have them.
"
," Ted: (to himself) But she's afraid of commitment.
"
," Ted: You don't have a 'but'.
"
," Ted: Why?
"
," Ted: So, what are the eye patches for?
"
," Ted: On the eye? Christy: Yes.
"
," Ted: Both of us.
"
," Ted: OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches.
"
," Ted: Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen.
"
," Ted: Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.
"
," Ted: Yeah, so?
"
," Ted: Yeah, if you're playing in the women's league.
"
," Ted: I hate to say it, buddy, but you're kinda' irrelevant.
"
," Ted: First of all, I did not ask to see that list and I am still horrified. True game is about quality, not quantity. And a quality girl would pick me over you any day.
"
," Ted: Fine.
"
," Ted: Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.
"
," Ted: You're on.
"
," Ted: OK, great. Rule number one, no eye patches or props of any kind.
"
," Ted: Just stop. You're bumming everybody out.
"
," Ted: Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars.
"
," Ted: How?
"
," Ted: Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook.
"
," Ted: Oh, Interesting. Look who just took a commanding lead. Now, with you out of the picture, I can take my sweet time.
"
," Ted: Get out of my way.
"
," Ted: Well, have fun in yoga.
"
," Ted: She's strengthening her core. That's gonna be good.
"
," Ted: Yeah, all right. After a while, crocodile.
"
," Ted: You see this. Game face.
"
," Ted: Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that?
"
," Ted: You're right, it counts. It counts as one. You've had s*x once. How was it? Hazel: I still matter.
"
," Ted: Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing.
"
," Ted: Freddie, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?
"
," Ted: Fine.
"
," Ted: Hey, who drew the picture of Nelson?
"
," Ted: ""My new mommy."" Kinda has a nice ring to it.
"
," Ted: Me too.
"
," Ted: Mm-hm.
"
," Ted: Well, I couldn't do it. I broke up with her. Thanks a lot by the way. A beautiful, sexy girl and all I could think about was you being there first. You were stuck in my head like a Chumbawumba song.
"
," Ted: What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped.
"
," Ted: OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any...
"
," Ted: So you never slept with her?
"
," Ted: Well., have fun in yoga
"
," Ted: After a while crocodile.
"
," Ted: You are a sociopath. That was my yoga mat.
"
," Ted: No, no, this doesn't prove anything because...
"
," Ted: I should have just worn that stupid eye patch.
"
," Ted: And so, due to one architectural oversight, the Toledo Bridge Disaster of 1906 claimed the lives of 75 people. Now, I hate to stop while I'm on a roll, but happy Halloween, ya crazies!
"
," Ted: Nah, I got a thing. But you kids have fun trick or treating. This is a treat.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: It's not her nose that's in my ass, Lauren, it's her heart. My class loves me; I-I'm really making an impression on those guys. I'd like to make impression on those guys.
"
," Ted: Roy?
"
," Ted: Looks like that French maid didn't turn down somebody's bed.
"
," Ted: Come on, Shane.
"
," Ted: We get it.
"
," Ted: Uh, yes. (Troy arrives) Yes, it does.
"
," Ted: Please tell me you're not hooking up with one of your co-anchors again.
"
," Ted: Julian, you gotta not worry so much about being liked.
"
," Ted: Hmm... Boo... freakin'... hoo.
"
," Ted: Architecturally significant?! Zoey, you're very pretty. Your hair smells great.
"
," Ted: You don't know the first thing about architecture.
"
," Ted: I'm a professor, okay? I teach this stuff at one of the best colleges in the country. I don't go down to your place of non-employment and lecture you about how your little protest is a misguided waste of time, except whoops, I just did. Ha-burn.
"
," Ted: Well, I should head up.
"
," Ted: So, I'm assuming you all read the chapters on the Greek Revival architecture. Any questions?
"
," Ted: What are you doing here?
"
," Ted: Very well, then, let's get started. (clears throat) Some examples of Greek Revival architecture...
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: Getting back to Greek Revival...
"
," Ted: I lost them.
"
," Ted: We're familiar with it.
"
," Ted: Michele, my students are adults, and I treat them that way. I'll just give them more candy and make them a mix CD. Problem solved.
"
," Ted: Guys, Prof Rock is a really good mix, okay?
"
," Ted: Boo... freakin'...
"
," Ted: The one day I miss the sack circle, you guys sub her in?
"
," Ted: No. I was returning a hot dog costume that you all enjoyed.
"
," Ted: Like gangbusters. We're buddies again. After class, we hacked a little sack to the thumpin' strains of my Prof Rock CD. And no, none of them had heard the Pixies B-side. Actually, none of them had heard of the Pixies. Or a B-side.
"
," Ted: I'm trying to eat here, buddy.
"
," Ted: Good morning, everybody... Where's my class?
"
," Ted: It didn't work. They hate me. How do I get them to like me again?
"
," Ted: I like my teachers.
"
," Ted: Was there more to that story?
"
," Ted: Roberto, you're a psychopath.
"
," Ted: Anyone not in class tomorrow gets an ""F.""
"
," Ted: Well, technically, they'd get an incomplete, but I thought ""F"" had a nice, scary ring to it. Right?
"
," Ted: What... Why didn't you tell us?
"
," Ted: Wow! I can't wait to see it.
"
," Ted: Jeanette,
"
," Ted: No!
"
," Ted: Sorry, can not stay.
"
," Ted: Nice set of forms.
"
," Ted: Believe it or not, my friends do not have a say on which I frequent. This is my life. I decide.
"
," Ted: I arrive.
"
," Ted: Hi, guys. Bad news: I was Karen plated. Go ahead.
"
," Ted: This is totally stupid. We were together, you know, we laughed...
"
," Ted: It's you who love the Chianti 2002.
"
," Ted: Looks like the earring Dwayne. Bizarre. It's you...
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: What? Of course not! She had to be found in the laundry.
"
," Ted: Maybe because I've always been faithful, when thou hast deceived me 6 times, bitch.
"
," Ted: Right? I too would have said that.
"
," Ted: Maybe because I've always been faithful, while you... I love you...
"
," Ted: That's it. She's gone.
"
," Ted: A coffin.
"
," Ted: It's not an anecdote, it's a porno.
"
," Ted: I know. I live with Steven for 12 years. Every time I put something, it's a victory.
"
," Ted: I arrive.
"
," Ted: Gail, I found an earring William on your dresser. You know why the other was in my bed?
"
," Ted: You hate Karen. You told me to break it. It's you. Did you put the loop in my bed for Karen to find.
"
," Ted: Admit it!
"
," Ted: Why was it on your dresser?
"
," Ted: I swear, if you tell me the truth on the field...
"
," Ted: You made me break with Karen? Are you sick? What right did you do that?
"
," Ted: What is this test?
"
," Ted: I can not believe you did that.
"
," Ted: It's pretty awesome.
"
," Ted: I confirm. You can cross your legs?
"
," Ted: I know. I mean, I guess if you get all this for Karen, then it may be better.
"
," Ted: ""Redo""? How many times you made me break with my girlfriends?
"
," Ted: Like who?
"
," Ted: Creed? Oh, my God, I have to break up with her.
"
," Ted: Who else?
"
," Ted: That was you? It's crazy!
"
," Ted: And if one of them was to be the mother of my children?
"
," Ted: Or Catherine. Or Catherine. You made us break too? You made us break too?
"
," Ted: You have made us break up?
"
," Ted: You have made us break up?
"
," Ted: You have made us break up?
"
," Ted: You made me break with Steven?
"
," Ted: I can not believe it. I need another drink.
"
," Ted: Seriously, just what is your problem? How could you do that?
"
," Ted: Katherine has just told us it made us break.
"
," Ted: It turns out that Jeremy has decided to sabotage many of my relationships, including ours.
"
," Ted: Where do you see yourself in five years?
"
," Ted: I would probably get married.
"
," Ted: In Argentina?
"
," Ted: We have a deadline, does not it?
"
," Ted: You can not manipulate people like that! I've known you for 12 years, but I've never been back!
"
," Ted: I want to hear!
"
," Ted: Stop cuddling! You got no right to interfere in my relationships you. You're lucky. You have found the love of your life in a dorm you turn 18. It gives you no right to play God while others are still looking for. You worry so much about who will finish with you on the porch. You know what? Keep it for you.
"
," Ted: I realized that no matter what my friends think of my girlfriend, but it really matters what my girlfriend thinks of my friends.
"
," Ted: Yes. If you wanna be my guest, Lillie is a sacred stove.
"
," Ted: Normal Peter dies at age 68.
"
," Ted: It makes you wonder.
"
," Ted: Maybe. She was right. We were not ready. We needed to move forward, we do our stuff. It is always the case.
"
," Ted: Will you be my wife back?
"
," Ted: Okay, that's it. Do we must etablire rules?
"
," Ted: I know. As not to become huge, that sort of thing.
"
," Ted: I'll never wear.
"
," Ted: Stay strong, Teddy. We can do this.
"
," Ted: Dude, that's my girlfriend.
"
," Ted: You know it.
"
," Ted: At first, yes, but we figured out a great way to deal with it: we never talk about it. And since then, we've really been enjoying each other's company.
"
," Ted: Yeah, but you'd be surprised. It doesn't even come up that often.
"
," Ted: So Oprah's retiring. Oof! What's that world gonna be like?
"
," Ted: So, they found water on Mars. What?
"
," Ted: Hey, Marsh, you know that's another mirror, right?
"
," Ted: Hey, where are our chicken wings?
"
," Ted: Okay, I'm gonna go pick up Zoey, then we're off. See you Sunday.
"
," Ted: Bourbon. When I drink bourbon... I get weirdly good at beatboxing.
"
," Ted: Peace, I'm out.
"
," Ted: Peace. I'm out.
"
," Ted: You had to take that away from me, didn't you? (He takes a bottle of Bourbon out of his bag and put it on the table)
"
," Ted: What do you mean?
"
," Ted: Man, how did things get so screwed up?
"
," Ted: You and The Arcadian are ruining my life! What?
"
," Ted: We're talking about this. Look, I can handle you trying to prevent me from fulfilling a life-long dream. That's just being in a relationship. But now? You turn my best friend against me?
"
," Ted: Because he's going through a lot right now. He, he's looking for something to believe in, and you took advantage of that. You're, you're just like those Internet swindlers who tricked him into paying 300 bucks for a lock of Sasquatch fur.
"
," Ted: Okay. You know what? We're settling this once and for all.
"
," Ted: Well, here we are. I had a reservation at a four-star inn overlooking the ocean but, uh... How can that compete with such a beautiful, magnificent hotel? Welcome to The Arcadian. So here's the deal. If you can last until sunrise in your precious Arcadian, I'll join your side.
"
," Ted: That's not a chocolate.
"
," Ted: Dust just flew out of that comforter in the shape of a skull. Whoa, something just passed through me. Can you get STDs from the ghost of a prostitute?
"
," Ted: What are... What are you doing in our bathroom?
"
," Ted: Uh, these were supposed to be for a romantic dinner on our balcony as we were serenaded by the sounds of the ocean. But I guess we'll have to settle for what sounded like two very large men having s*x next door... with a third very small man.
"
," Ted: Okay. What is it? And don't give me, ""It's beautiful."" Don't give me, ""It's magnificent"" What is it about this place that makes you so passionate to save it?
"
," Ted: Why, why have you never told me that?
"
," Ted: I love you.
"
," Ted: You know, I guess this place isn't so bad.
"
," Ted: What was what?
"
," Ted: I don't see anything.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God! It's the cock-a-mouse!
"
," Ted: Cock-a-mouse. Part cockroach, part mouse. It used to live in our apartment. It must have settled here, and... Oh! Look, it had babies! Good for it.
"
," Ted: Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too.
"
," Ted: A hat? This is brilliant. I love it! Nothing better to say ""delicious"" as inside a cowboy hat. I tell you, I'm your man. I think being born to draw this building. I... I see.
"
," Ted: I see it. I see it. (Grace enters) What is it good?
"
," Ted: I told them I had a vision for this thing. They want a drawing in a week and I have nothing!
"
," Ted: Cute? I can draw concert halls and bridges. Bridges so beautiful they could be in museums. And I could draw these museums. But I draw, what instead? Where is my career? A two-story Stetson... with a terrace on the edge. It's a cosmic joke. The universe conspires against me.
"
," Ted: Yeah, that'll solve everything. I have not slept for 34 hours, but a bagel is the answer. Cinnamon and raisin bagel with some cream. It looks good. I'll buy one.
"
," Ted: Your show has a clown to present the weather? It's a bit nase, right?
"
," Ted: Okay. You want to fire me from here, I go out. I look forward to seeing what the universe has prepared me.
"
," Ted: Wait, why did you vomit?
"
," Ted: Come on. Tell me.
"
," Ted: I will raise this child with you. You're not alone. You can get married if you want, but I want to see other girls, it would be one of those marriages...
"
," Ted: Where?
"
," Ted: Where was your meal?
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Why do you not tell me where you got your intoxication?
"
," Ted: It makes sense. Do not say anything.
"
," Ted: This Indian restaurant where the cat jumps on the tables?
"
," Ted: The Spanish restaurant with the cradle?
"
," Ted: Is it here? Tell me!
"
," Ted: Why do you have told me? Schlegel's? Thank you! I'll have to find another New York place that serves bagels.
"
," Ted: ""What does your paintball on your personality? ""
"
," Ted: ""The last 3 kilos: how the push to lose. ""
"
," Ted: Petra Petrova.
"
," Ted: These magazines are broken. It is certainly retouched.
"
," Ted: You are my hero! Really? How did you do?
"
," Ted: Of course it is. Marry them! It.
"
," Ted: The 200th with that... get laid?
"
," Ted: Even if I was wearing protective clothing. 200 is too much!
"
," Ted: Who are these girls? It was rhetorical. Show me the list.
"
," Ted: 200 is too much.
"
," Ted: That's too!
"
," Ted: Who said so?
"
," Ted: I think he'll say it again very slowly.
"
," Ted: are you gonna do? You will find not a partner in the next 2 hours.
"
," Ted: Where did Shane? It's been over an hour.
"
," Ted: It has happened to you what?
"
," Ted: Why wait till then?
"
," Ted: Congratulations!
"
," Ted: Go! Happened to you at 200. You should be proud. You should be tested, but you should be proud. We do not care if Pauline does not pose in bikinis in magazines.
"
," Ted: Any visual representation of data.
"
," Ted: Mosbius Designs.
"
," Ted: They were thrown.
"
," Ted: That's an intervention. You could not stop eating, so we threw your cam.
"
," Ted: You make tables work?
"
," Ted: Damn. Not move. I bring them.
"
," Ted: I'm sorry, Milt? I think these are my paintings.
"
," Ted: This is my blanket. We'll see later. But I need these tables.
"
," Ted: Okay, how?
"
," Ted: I give you five dollars.
"
," Ted: No one will pay a million for these pictures!
"
," Ted: OK, Milt, you won. I will give one million.
"
," Ted: The problem is that the distributor...
"
," Ted: The alien time machine has a withdrawal limit. That's what I'll do. I give you a dollar... per day... for a million days.
"
," Ted: I'll walk you out.
"
," Ted: Awesome! You're finally getting better.
"
," Ted: Yes!
"
," Ted: Mounds.
"
," Ted: Gobstoppers.
"
," Ted: Dubble Bubbles.
"
," Ted: You will not believe what just happened.
"
," Ted: I find a 1939 penny on the subway. Just imagine the history this little copper guy's seen...
"
," Ted: And you let me go first?! Have you seen her?
"
," Ted: How is she doing?
"
," Ted: She's happy? Jesse had the worst summer of his life and she's happy. And I suppose her art program was fulfilling or whatever.
"
," Ted: Oh, she's such a... godda... God! After what she did to Travis, she should come back here devastated. Crawling over the broken glass of her own shame and regret.
"
," Ted: She's unbelievable! Unbelievable!
"
," Ted: Uh, listen Sheila...
"
," Ted: OK, first of all, that is interesting. Second, we have to tell him.
"
," Ted: She's moved on?
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: She's miserable. She's realized she's made a huge mistake. Her and Janet will be back together in a week, I love it!
"
," Ted: Trust me. I've known Jeffrey for nine years.
"
," Ted: Yeah. But you're Canadian.
"
," Ted: You're our weird neighbors!
"
," Ted: No, alright. Five bucks says she still wants Dora.
"
," Ted: Five American bucks.
"
," Ted: Tequila. It's her weakness. Three shots, she tells you the truth about anything.
"
," Ted: Terrific.
"
," Ted: OK, we're way past truth-telling Ava and about to hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998 Ava, and I'm not cleaning that up again. So, congratulations. You win, she's happy.
"
," Ted: Interesting. Wow Phyllis, you, uh, seem to be having a pretty strong reaction to losing this apartment. I wonder is it because it reminds you of something you lost because you couldn't commit?
"
," Ted: Gravy.
"
," Ted: Surprise me.
"
," Ted: She's still drunk from last night.
"
," Ted: Look, if you want Byron back so bad, how come it took you two days to ask about him?
"
," Ted: But I thought your summer was great?!
"
," Ted: So all those interesting people you met on the bus...?
"
," Ted: In a heartbeat. If you called him up, yeah, he'd take you back with open arms.
"
," Ted: Maybe. No! This is... Ooww... Hold on. Look. If you're gonna go back to him, I don't wanna hear the word ""maybe"". ""Maybe"" cannot be in your vocabulary. This break-up almost killed him. And he cannot go through it again. So, unless you're absolutely certain, stay the hell away from him.
"
," Ted: ""Yes. The Arcadian should be a landmark."" And then the crowd gasps: ""Oh, my God! Did he really just say that? Oh, heavens! Oh, my stars! I must clutch my pearls!""
"
," Ted: Almost exclusively. But here's my point: If they ask GNB's chief architect... aka me... if The Arcadian should be a landmark, and I say ""yes""?
"
," Ted: Dude! That's my girlfriend. And ya know what? I'm on her side now, too.
"
," Ted: Mmm. Love you, too.
"
," Ted: Why does it need to rhyme?
"
," Ted: It's not because I'm mad at you. Dan, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been dead for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Julia, this is about the building.
"
," Ted: Okay, fine. It's about the girl! I am doing this for Zoey! I'm in love with her. Look, I know it's early, but there is a very good chance Zoey might be the mother of my children. So, in addition to doing this for John Clifford Larrabee, I'm also doing this for Luke and Leia.
"
," Ted: Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't. Isobel, I'm sorry.
"
," Ted: They're going to fire him? That sucks. He loves that job.
"
," Ted: No idea.
"
," Ted: There's nothing to think about. I-I can't lose Zoey. That's the only thing that matters to me right now.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: Yes
"
," Ted: We're done here.
"
," Ted: You said there was a third scenario.
"
," Ted: Okay, first of all, no ninja's getting a jump on me. I have the reflexes of a jungle... (George slaps him by surprise)
"
," Ted: Second of all, I don't care that the odds are stacked against us. I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey than spend the rest of my life alone playing Angry Birds, which, by the way, I've shown you how to download, like, 20 times.
"
," Ted: Thank you.
"
," Ted: Rene, what are you doing?
"
," Ted: Really? 'Cause it feels more like my insane friend renting a costume and breaking into my apartment in the middle of the night for what I wish I could say was the first time.
"
," Ted: Stephen, there's condoms in the drawer. Just take them and get out.
"
," Ted: Whoa! Lighting change!
"
," Ted: Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building, but... does that mean we have to knock it down? I mean, it's not bothering anyone. Just anyone who lives in it... Or looks at it... Or smells it.
"
," Ted: The Arcadian has to go, doesn't it?
"
," Ted: You realize this kind of screws up my personal life.
"
," Ted: This is a dream, right? Because, Andrew, I swear to God, if that's you...
"
," Ted: ""Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair""""
"
," Ted: Right. And I mistook you for a prostitute right... here.
"
," Ted: Worth every penny.
"
," Ted: No, we should get some sleep. But this was fun.
"
," Ted: Exactly.
"
," Ted: Yeah. Good night.
"
," Ted: No, it shouldn't be a landmark. There are a lot of important buildings in New York. The Arcadian isn't one of them.
"
," Ted: Yeah, that's me.
"
," Ted: This is a nightmare. I can't believe she kept that tape. The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow, and based on today...
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: What are we gonna do? We should buy a bar.
"
," Ted: Yes! Where the bartenders wear sexy judges' robes.
"
," Ted: That's not bad.
"
," Ted: Bernard, it's over. The good guys lost.
"
," Ted: We have to find Arthur right now.
"
," Ted: Zoey... Zoey!
"
," Ted: I don't know. Sometimes... things have to fall apart to make way for better things.
"
," Ted: Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore. You may now say what you really think of Zoey.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: But the thing of the pack?
"
," Ted: But... you are an inspiration to us all, you are so dedicated and linked. I look at you, and that's all I want in the world.
"
," Ted: Arizona... You know... I always wanted to see what looks like a license in Arizona.
"
," Ted: It's good. God thank you. What brings you here?
"
," Ted: You have a group? We will perhaps see you.
"
," Ted: Why?
"
," Ted: Yes, but these girls they sleep with Van Halen after?
"
," Ted: We are their fathers?
"
," Ted: If you want to see us afterwards, we can exchange our numbers.
"
," Ted: I know not what I was doing. I had panic there.
"
," Ted: You're still their father?
"
," Ted: That's all ""ski"" account.
"
," Ted: What is the problem here?
"
," Ted: Thank you.
"
," Ted: Bluntly.
"
," Ted: We would still have had to make their numbers.
"
," Ted: It's really bad outside. They will not.
"
," Ted: Sorry, a ""Bingo party student""?
"
," Ted: How many people are on this festive bingo student?
"
," Ted: What is the purpose then?
"
," Ted: And you got what, if you succeed?
"
," Ted: No! It is only 21h.
"
," Ted: You can leave it open a little more? We monitor everything.
"
," Ted: Seriously?
"
," Ted: There should be a bar.
"
," Ted: You really should have a bar.
"
," Ted: Our bar would be great.
"
," Ted: That's... a great name for a bar! And also, Puzzles: no nightcap.
"
," Ted: Except where everyone ended up spending the best night of his life, then we put the chairs on the tables and pulled out the margarita fountain.
"
," Ted: There should be a bar.
"
," Ted: I'm going to recover.
"
," Ted: Barman. Triple Sec.
"
," Ted: Served.
"
," Ted: We will buy one.
"
," Ted: Prem's.
"
," Ted: It can get warm with a glass?
"
," Ted: I guess you could stay open longer. As it is you and the group? (The bar is crowded) Melissa, what kind of group is it?
"
," Ted: Dude, Carl is going to kill us if we turn not everyone immediately. I'm serious. He promised not to mess. Okay, you score a point. The bar is open! Who wants a beer?
"
," Ted: There's no sink. And you get out of the kitchen.
"
," Ted: Hold a bar, it sucks. Is closed.
"
," Ted: We said no last drink. We must do.
"
," Ted: We can do one thing.
"
," Ted: Caring for a bar, it's boring. We should stick to what we know.
"
," Ted: Of course! Why was not yet formed a band?
"
," Ted: Dude, I do not believe that you've ever done this far.You'll have to go back and redo all that way again tomorrow.
"
," Ted: Grace you really dredged?
"
," Ted: You're not really looking for it?
"
," Ted: So, on New Year's kiss, calls for lunch, all... ""I ate it today,"" you're really going to drop it?
"
," Ted: Puzzles.
"
," Ted: We're not really doing shots, are we?
"
," Ted: Where are you going, buddy? Hot date?
"
," Ted: Wait, you're really going out with a billionaire?
"
," Ted: So, uh, where's Thurston Howell taking you?
"
," Ted: See ya.
"
," Ted: Sure, why?
"
," Ted: OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for...
"
," Ted: Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?
"
," Ted: Daddy's home?
"
," Ted: You want us to go over there right now and say to those girls, 'daddy's home.' Really think about that, Zoe.
"
," Ted: Oh, daddy's back. See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that...
"
," Ted: That worked. I hate the world.
"
," Ted: So, I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped.
"
," Ted: So, what? You want me to do a shot.
"
," Ted: Mathew, I think you've officially...
"
," Ted: Ah, Ben, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being?
"
," Ted: Let me tell you something about this brain, OK?
"
," Ted: Even alcohol cannot stop this brain.
"
," Ted: This brain, dear mortals, is no ordinary brain.
"
," Ted: This is a superbrain.
"
," Ted: This brain is unstoppable. This brain...
"
," Ted: OK, what the hell happened last night?
"
," Ted: I drank all five, bitch.
"
," Ted: Jose thinks you're a vampire.
"
," Ted: How quickly you all forget. I haven't puked since high school. I am vomit-free since ninety-three. Vomit free since ninety-three. That's funny. I'm funny.
"
," Ted: Taylor.
"
," Ted: Hello Zoe, it's Ted.
"
," Ted: Hello Kenneth, it's Ted.
"
," Ted: Beverly, have I ever told you that I'm vomit-free since ninety-three?
"
," Ted: I don't say this enough, but you're a great woman, and a great reporter. You should be on 60 Minutes. You should be one of the minutes.
"
," Ted: Yeah, and I disagree with Anne. Just 'cause this guy is spending a lot of money doesn't mean you have to put out. Take it slow, Sofia, take it slow. Slow.
"
," Ted: Slow.
"
," Ted: I need that phone back.
"
," Ted: Thank you kind sir. At least someone appreciates the fact that I'm doing and not thinking. And now I don't think I won't not go to the bathroom.
"
," Ted: Hey, it's me again.
"
," Ted: (singing along with jukebox) Plain to see again.
"
," Ted: (singing along with jukebox) Please can I see you every day?
"
," Ted: (yelling to everyone in bar) I love everyone in this bar.
"
," Ted: (singing along with jukebox) I'm a fool again.
"
," Ted: (singing along with jukebox) I fell in love...
"
," Ted: Well, that explains the ankle.
"
," Ted: Was there anyone else in there with me?
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: I don't know.
"
," Ted: What the hell happened to my jacket? Russell: Whoa.
"
," Ted: Why are you sleeping in our tub?
"
," Ted: You guys take care of me. You guys are the best. I love you guys so much.
"
," Ted: I'm back baby doll!
"
," Ted: I think....
"
," Ted: Bring it.
"
," Ted: I'm calling Joan.
"
," Ted: Oh yeah? What you gonna do?
"
," Ted: You're bluffing.
"
," Ted: Hello, Leslie, it's Ted.
"
," Ted: You set me on fire.
"
," Ted: You set me on fire. And who's the girl in my bed?
"
," Ted: I have no idea.
"
," Ted: You really don't know who that is?
"
," Ted: I better not have gotten burned.
"
," Ted: Did any of you write that?
"
," Ted: I don't know.
"
," Ted: Uh, hi, who is this?
"
," Ted: It's Ted.
"
," Ted: Mildred, you've always taken care of me. You are a gentleman and a scholar. Go into my stable and take my finest stallion. He's yours, his name is Windjammer.
"
," Ted: I'm back, baby doll! Ted: And I am gonna throw up.
"
," Ted: I threw up? My streak is over. Vomit-free since '05 doesn't sound good. Sorry, Carl, go on.
"
," Ted: Carl, did you know the word karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra? Isn't that hauntingly beautiful? Are you a vampire? Carl: I am cutting you off. Go home and get some sleep, Ted.
"
," Ted: Yeah, sun's gonna come up soon. Wouldn't want to be around for that, would we?
"
," Ted: Hey, how easy do you think it'll be to sneak into the zoo? I have to see some penguins, like right now.
"
," Ted: That tickles.
"
," Ted: Thanks Carl. We can't just be friends, we're attracted to each other and we both know it.
"
," Ted: Me and Tonya. Me and Tonya, I have to make one more call.
"
," Ted: Hey, it's me again. Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life, so shy don't you come over to my apartment and we'll think of something stupid to do together? Really? Great. Wait, really? Great.
"
," Ted: Thanks Carl.
"
," Ted: It's Tracy. That's Tracy in there.
"
," Ted: Still, what does this mean? Are we dating now? I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it...
"
," Ted: Wake her up and say what?
"
," Ted: Hello.
"
," Ted: Are you sure?
"
," Ted: Hey, Beatrice, how are you?
"
," Ted: Yeah, sure, come on over.
"
," Ted: No, wait, don't, no.
"
," Ted: She's coming over. Crap.
"
," Ted: I love everyone in this bar.
"
," Ted: What are you doing in the men's room? What am I doing in the ladies' room? Oh right, I came in here 'cause I thought I was gonna throw up.
"
," Ted: I did not.
"
," Ted: And the streak continues. Vomit-free since '93.
"
," Ted: Sorry, Trudy, go on.
"
," Ted: What? The karaoke? Domo arigato.
"
," Ted: Do it.
"
," Ted: I'm something stupid, do me.
"
," Ted: Hey, can I call you sometime? Trudy: OK.
"
," Ted: Why do they call it karaoke anyhow? Was it invented by a woman named Carrie Okie? These are the kinds of things I think about. Trudy: Karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra.
"
," Ted: That's hauntingly beautiful.
"
," Ted: Hey, it works.
"
," Ted: I need to make one more call.
"
," Ted: Hey, it's me again.
"
," Ted: Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life.
"
," Ted: Uh, Claude's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom.
"
," Ted: No, that's not my girlfriend. Look, it's complicated.
"
," Ted: No, I'm not married. Um, I'll explain after you hide.
"
," Ted: Hi.
"
," Ted: Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was very drunk.
"
," Ted: Come on, those calls weren't that weird.
"
," Ted: (recording form phone) Annie! Come hang out! OK, I'm gonna make this sound until you come hang out.
"
," Ted: Without a breath? That's gotta be some kind of record.
"
," Ted: No I'm not. Look, I just turned off my brain for the night. Nothing's changed, you've moved on, I've moved on.
"
," Ted: Yes. What, you don't believe me?
"
," Ted: Oh, OK.
"
," Ted: Trudy, come on out.
"
," Ted: Trudy, come on out.
"
," Ted: Seriously, it's OK. This is so Trudy. She's really shy, I think.
"
," Ted: Trudy?
"
," Ted: I'm not making this up. She must have climbed out the fire escape.
"
," Ted: Whatever, whatever. I don't care what you think.
"
," Ted: Really? Well.
"
," Ted: Instead of stuffing, I'm going to fill the turkey with... a slightly smaller turkey. It's called a Turturkeykey!
"
," Ted: Your loss. All right, it's dead in here. I'm gonna call it a little early.
"
," Ted: Wh... you sure? We got big plans.
"
," Ted: Well, tonight, we're doing the same thing, only with ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's Greatest Hits and Apocalypse Now.
"
," Ted: Completely naked!
"
," Ted: At the exact moment Brando first appeared, ""Weird Al"" launched right into ""Eat It.""
"
," Ted: Free beer for everyone!
"
," Ted: All right, first of all... there's nothing lame about brining a Turturkeykey, copyright pending. And secondly, I don't believe ""The Curse of The Blitz"" is real. (gasps)
"
," Ted: What the hell happened here?
"
," Ted: Aw, man! No, no! Let's get one thing straight, okay? I am not The Blitz.
"
," Ted: Please stop. Okay, fine.
"
," Ted: Wait! Wait! Wait! What's that? What's ""The Gentleman""?
"
," Ted: I'm not The Blitz! (Ted goes into the bathroom, he hears a person yawning and opens the bath curtain) Zoey?
"
," Ted: How could you, my best friends in the world, hang out with my mortal enemy, then let her sleep in the tub where I clean myself?!
"
," Ted:I'm not The Blitz!
"
," Ted: Finish the story, Red.
"
," Ted: I missed a skateboarding dog?
"
," Ted: It wasn't?
"
," Ted: Wait. Blitz was there, too?
"
," Ted: I'm not The Blitz!
"
," Ted: What? No! N- n-n-n-no! N-n-no! I'm not The Blitz! The only thing I missed last night was my best friends stabbing me in the back by hanging out with my worst enemy. Guys! I hate Zoey! That means you're supposed to hate her, too! Th-that's your rule, Bobby!
"
," Ted: Tried?! Hunter, do you have any idea how many people I've blindly hated for you? I hated Renée Zellweger with a burning passion for eight years, only to discover you meant Reese Witherspoon!
"
," Ted: That's Kate Hudson!
"
," Ted: No, we hate Zoey! I'm so furious at you all right now, but it's Thanksgiving, and I have a Turturkeykey to make. And not that I'm The Blitz, but could everyone please come with me into the kitchen? (all murmuring) Okay, I'm, uh, just gonna preheat the oven.
"
," Ted: Great. So not only did you guys betray me, but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving?
"
," Ted: It doesn't help. 4G? No. What-What are we supposed to do now?
"
," Ted: Chester, I don't know if the oven is deep enough. Plus, it's a display made of cardboard.
"
," Ted: It's not awesome!
"
," Ted: No. Absolutely not.
"
," Ted: No. I'm not The Blitz. I'm The Bueller. You know what this means. You're The Blitz.
"
," Ted: Chicka-chicka!
"
," Ted: Zoey.
"
," Ted: Okay, the Turturkeykey is officially cooking.
"
," Ted: Okay, guys, that's starting to hurt.
"
," Ted: Oh, what was that? I was distracted by the four-caret diamond your 53-year-old husband bought you.
"
," Ted: Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a turturkeykey to baste.
"
," Ted: No... I baste alone.
"
," Ted: Who canceled? Your coven?
"
," Ted: Are you happy? You're ruining Thanksgiving.
"
," Ted: Oh... I'm sorry, Lena. I'm just never going to like that woman.
"
," Ted: Enemies can't become friends.
"
," Ted: No, no, no. You guys can't be objective. You still feel guilty about last night.
"
," Ted: Who are we gonna...
"
," Ted: Really? Wang Guy? We're asking Wang Guy?
"
," Ted: Guys, despite the wit and wisdom of Wang Guy, Zoey and I are never going to be friends. We're just here for her oven and that's it.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God!
"
," Ted: What? No. It was an accident.
"
," Ted: Oh, great. Real mature.
"
," Ted: Morris, those are cartoon characters, and I'm pretty sure you're making up episodes. And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!
"
," Ted: I guess we're going home.
"
," Ted: Nathaniel, where'd you get that?
"
," Ted: And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!
"
," Ted: We have to go back to Zoey's.
"
," Ted: Craig let us in.
"
," Ted: Look, I'm sorry your stepdaughter didn't want to spend Thanksgiving with you.
"
," Ted: I just do. It must be tough.
"
," Ted: I get that. Uh, you should hang on to this. You can give it to her next year.
"
," Ted: Hey, you never know. People don't stay enemies forever.
"
," Ted: Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes as good as it looks.
"
," Ted: People freaked out because of a calibrated in suits who bothered their children?
"
," Ted: Derrick, you're too old to put toilet paper because you can play laser tag more. And by the way, too old for laser tag.
"
," Ted: Yeah, whatever. I added laser tag to the list of Murtaugh.
"
," Ted: It's hard to admit, but with age, we can do certain things.This is why I have this list, not to make the mistake of thinking that I can still make a sleepless night.
"
," Ted: Or eat a whole pizza in one sitting.
"
," Ted: Or put posters on the wall without a frame.
"
," Ted: Nathan, you have more 18 years. If you did the whole list, you would die. It was not a challenge.
"
," Ted: And if you fail?
"
," Ted: It works for me. Marc, you do the honors?
"
," Ted: There's some pretty hefty on the list. Finally, do you really think Enrique is going to get ear pierced?
"
," Ted: You got anything in your ear? It looks like the inside of a pumpkin after Halloween.
"
," Ted: OK, Craig? You seem to have a bad back.
"
," Ted: This guy. Life is a meal and old age, the dessert. I get so many worries about the future. Where will my career? Who will I marry? When you're old, you do not worry, because all this has happened before. You got pumps and a comfortable seat for the stairs. That's perfect.
"
," Ted: I thought that, too, you'll understand when you grow older.
"
," Ted: I hate to refuse, but you told me that the turkey was extremely thin, and see for yourself.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Removes ""colonoscopy"" and ""sleeping with an old"", and is a cinch.
"
," Ted: Well, if I finished first, it's six hours of study of American architecture from the early 20th, and you can not ever do something in the list of Murtaugh. This is for your own good.
"
," Ted: ""Put on reading glasses. ""Done. ""Yelled the boy from the neighborhood. ""With pleasure. (Ted was about to leave when Zoe and Yolanda come but this box) What happened to you?
"
," Ted: How did you do?
"
," Ted: 16 pm! Supper time.
"
," Ted: Got up at 4am... Done.
"
," Ted: Okay. ""Take time to answer the phone. ""
"
," Ted: Done.
"
," Ted: It happens. I found these weird Russian beers, in the basement.
"
," Ted: Yes, it's... a little hot. I hope this is not a problem.
"
," Ted: You know, yesterday I went to bed at 20h because it was on the list and I could not sleep... because it was 20h. So I watched Lethal Weapon.
"
," Ted: I still could not sleep, so I watched Lethal Weapon 2. And then 3. And in the middle of Lethal Weapon 4, I realized...
"
," Ted:... that Murtaugh kept repeating: ""I'm too old for this stuff,"" but every time he says, he changes his mind, made another movie, and stuff. What I'm trying to say is that... the toilet, age.Will cover the PQ laser tag.
"
," Ted: Oh, geez.
"
," Ted: Yeah, right.
"
," Ted: Since Eduardo and Brandy have their apartment, her mother keeps sending him old things she wants to get rid.
"
," Ted: Hello?
"
," Ted: Yes.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: The window is open.
"
," Ted: Veronica, the window is open. Fight your way, watercourse Ted, run!
"
," Ted: Hey, Maggie. I was just, you know, hmm... How are you?
"
," Ted: Oh, sorry for you. Wanna go out tonight?
"
," Ted: I arrived!
"
," Ted: You see how everyone knows a person, and whatever happens, this person is perfect for you.
"
," Ted: Well this girl was and still is Maggie Wilks.
"
," Ted: It was not the fact that Maggie was good. It was the...
"
," Ted: It was the perfect girl next door. And still is. All the guys who meet Maggie fall madly in love with her. And that's the problem. Since I know her, she has been single for only three short windows of time.
"
," Ted: When she moved here and broke up with her boyfriend in college, I waited one month, not to go for the spare wheel. And the spare wheel well, he stayed two years. After their breakup, I have waited a week. Late again. She stayed with guys for 3 years.
"
," Ted: The third time, I was super fast. I got not even one hour after their breakup. The only thing she has made between the break and I arrived, it's down to her mail.
"
," Ted: Late again. And she went out with him four years. I would not let me have it again. So I begged her neighbor, Ms. Doglas, call me when she and David have broken loose.
"
," Ted: And now, a single and Maggie is available along the way to this bar right now. I made him take a taxi with a woman driver for there is no interaction with a man, so far.
"
," Ted: Ok, game plan Maggie arrives, a few minutes of gathering and presentation, and everyone leaves us. This is my only chance, and I will not go wrong.
"
," Ted: Damn!
"
," Ted: I want you to Maggie Kay, my roommate.
"
," Ted: I completely forgot, I teach a class tonight. How would you like to come and see what happens during an architecture?
"
," Ted: Super. Sit down, put yourself at ease. Relaxed, everything is relaxed. Listen, you want me to find the perfect girl for you so all together, it's her. Do not let a guy to approach her. No server to take our order, clean the table, and if it ignites, I want a female firefighter to extinguish.
"
," Ted: Phillip Good God, do what you need to keep single until my return. I pay the bill, but do not abuse.
"
," Ted: Good evening, tonight we will quickly see the different bridges. There are 6 types of bridges, small, large, with suspension and three others. You land on each side and water in the middle. See you next week.
"
," Ted: Who wants to hear me talk about bridges for 1 hour? (All raise their hands) Really?
"
," Ted: One important thing to remember when designing a bridge.
"
," Ted: No. Finally yes. When you design a bridge remember: ""Make Adjustments... Fetch energetically"" (""Make Ajustments Energize Go Get It"" Maggie acronym in English) Good advice in general too.
"
," Ted: No, I mean it's just that girl that interests me very long time.And tonight this is my chance to get away with it.
"
," Ted: Yes Jamie, she is very pretty. We can now finish the course. Betty?
"
," Ted: Bluntly. I think. Perhaps. I dunno, you think what?
"
," Ted: You're left with Maggie Alexis?
"
," Ted: You do not understand, this girl is like a magnet to men... overkill.
"
," Ted: What does mean to be ready? I thought I was ready last year and I was left on the altar. I'll be honest. I'm scared! Ok, Luis and Betty!
"
," Ted: I mean, if you're not afraid you do not try your luck... and if you do not try your luck then... What are you doing? Not?
"
," Ted: Ok, I gotta go!
"
," Ted: Hello?
"
," Ted: You let him with Andrew?
"
," Ted: You're an animal!
"
," Ted: 10 minutes?
"
," Ted: How could you?
"
," Ted: Put yourself on the line Bob!
"
," Ted: I'm in love with her for 12 years!
"
," Ted: Guys, guys, guys! We must fix that.
"
," Ted: Wait, where is Maggie?
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Wait, she's right. Maggie deserves a little time for her.Nobody likes to be alone, especially after a break but... This is where we discover who we really are... and what you really want. She deserves it!
"
," Ted: Oh, sorry, the course we had a little... Who is it?
"
," Ted: Yeah, sure!
"
," Ted: Well... I'll see you next time!
"
," Ted: I do not want the ""giddy ups."" That's what I want. I had forgotten how it felt to seeking the real thing... but I think I'm ready again.
"
," Ted: Please do not.
"
," Ted: Please, stop.
"
," Ted: Mom, mom, it's good. You're not obliged to ask you with him. There's full of guys...
"
," Ted: Yeah! Finally, I... I'm glad you're happy.
"
," Ted: I love to listen to you, Mom.
"
," Ted: Oh my God.
"
," Ted: I gotta go.
"
," Ted: Inventing an emergency or anything. I... I... I'll get it.
"
," Ted: Hi, guys.
"
," Ted: Oh, that's fine. I'm in top form. Go. We'll take a look!
"
," Ted: First, let me tell you what happened on the wedding day.
"
," Ted: Watching my mother to marry, I realized how I was late in relation to it on my life. I'm just going to leave here. So I walked into my hotel room and I went on a website where I go sometimes when I have trouble sleeping.
"
," Ted: I have not spent... It is not that part of the night I was talking about.
"
," Ted: I was on my favorite site for real estate auction... Come on, we all did... visit some properties on the site.
"
," Ted: Guys... I just bought the house of my dreams.
"
," Ted: I mean, I put an online auction and I won the next day and I was accepted. I have just finalized all the paperwork.
"
," Ted: So, I thought this piece would be the desktop. You see, a place just for dad. I mean, kids can come if they read a book, but no toy. This is not about to hold my love. It is rather a question of drawing a boundary.
"
," Ted: I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move.
"
," Ted: Okay, okay. I know. I have not found Ms. Mosby yet, but I will get it. Knock on wood.
"
," Ted: Thank you.
"
," Ted: Gamin.
"
," Ted: Oh, great! I began to think that you would not come.
"
," Ted: Hmm.
"
," Ted: Well, yeah.
"
," Ted: Hey, check the porch, huh? Go. I will put a gate there.Every Sunday here, it'll be a huge party sausage.
"
," Ted: Burgers, burgers will be made.
"
," Ted: Hector, listen to me. I had a plan, right? A woman, a house, children, and it turned out that the universe is really sh1t to what is the wife and children. So what is the thing I can control? The house I bought. It's not a huge mistake.
"
," Ted: You can always have problems with any decision, but you can not let that stop you. First day in college, Sofia knew he wanted to spend his life with you. And if someone was there to contradict his decision?
"
," Ted: But Cody took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.
"
," Ted: Really?
"
," Ted: And if I had already bought the son of a bitch?
"
," Ted: Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here.
"
," Ted: You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Laurie and Don. Dora, perhaps this is a new tie?
"
," Ted: Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house.
"
," Ted: What do you mean?
"
," Ted: Please, stop.
"
," Ted: What are you talking about?
"
," Ted: What does that mean?
"
," Ted: Guys, I'm in trouble. I mean, the best I can do is to improve the house and sell the property with great losses.
"
," Ted: It's silly.
"
," Ted: Thank you Mike. It was fantastic.
"
," Ted: There... there is one last thing I should do.
"
," Ted: Hi.
"
," Ted: I have not been able to make your speech. I was selfish and I freaked out and I'm so sorry, so... and here... ""A hand sign for the Dj? Dee made the sign... ""I pass. ""Mom, I love you, and I've never seen him so happy with Clint. And Clint, welcome in the family... what you both is what I'd really like to have someday. But in the meantime, health to you both. I love you. ""
"
," Ted: Hey.
"
," Ted: How did you know that I would be here today?
"
," Ted: But I told you the last time I saw you I was coming home.
"
," Ted: Please stay here with me, man.
"
," Ted: I can... I can give you some ideas I have?
"
," Ted: It's our NCAA bracket.
"
," Ted: Big board!
"
," Ted: Yeah. The winner gets $100,000 stuffed in a duffel bag.
"
," Ted: That's because in the past, we were just guessing. This year, we watched every game, read box scores, tracked injuries. This isn't March Madness. This is March Meticulously Thought-outness.
"
," Ted: I didn't know they were playing today.
"
," Ted: Single girl, mid-twenties, looking for a canine replacement for the boyfriend who just dumped her. Instead, finds Roy.
"
," Ted: I'm really bored at work.
"
," Ted: Look, if you want to figure out who it is, why don't you just start by checking your list?
"
," Ted: Come on, let's see the list.
"
," Ted: How many of these girls know they're being photographed?
"
," Ted: It's 12 hours to live! That girl flew them both to Paris!
"
," Ted: Kidney!
"
," Ted: Fake baby!
"
," Ted: I was there. Trust me. It's fake baby.
"
," Ted: You got to go scuba instructor.
"
," Ted: She got the bends!
"
," Ted: Prince of Norway! How could it not be Prince of Norway?!
"
," Ted: You're kidding me!
"
," Ted: I want to call my mom, just tell her I love her.
"
," Ted: I don't know. That's a lot riding on a girl who giggles when she lies.
"
," Ted: Have you ever fallen asleep while eating ribs?
"
," Ted: Dude, dude, dude, look. Blonde girl heading over to Paula right now. We are go.
"
," Ted: Are you okay?
"
," Ted: Kids you know that photo in the den? It was taken back in 2006, when Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me and we all went out to brunch. We all look pretty happy, right? Wrong.
"
," Ted: I'm going to kill him.
"
," Ted: No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him.
"
," Ted: You mean the spa the judge ordered him to go to to quit cocaine?
"
," Ted: What's wrong?
"
," Ted: Hey, Claude.
"
," Ted: I'm going to kill him.
"
," Ted: No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him.
"
," Ted: Naomi, what are you doing here?
"
," Ted: I haven't told them any legendary Benjamin stories.
"
," Ted: Priscilla, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about: baseball.
"
," Ted: Well, actually Wilma's my...
"
," Ted: Well, Gabe's actually...
"
," Ted: Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.
"
," Ted: I know you've all been excited to meet...
"
," Ted: Uh, Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend, Esther.
"
," Ted: Stop it! Don't, don't!
"
," Ted: Yeah, I'm sure my folks are gonna want...
"
," Ted: Cervezas? Did he fall?
"
," Ted: Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?
"
," Ted: Why?
"
," Ted: My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Tamara, is... Is my dad cool?
"
," Ted: Sure.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God!
"
," Ted: My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible.
"
," Ted: Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use ""83%""?
"
," Ted: That's not a real Web site.
"
," Ted: Hi, Dad.
"
," Ted: Enjoying your vacation so far?
"
," Ted: Uh, listen, can I speak to you outside for a sec?
"
," Ted: So you went out with Rick last night?
"
," Ted: You have a good time?
"
," Ted: Yeah. So...
"
," Ted: Well...
"
," Ted: You think Cerrano's got a shot at the RBI title?
"
," Ted: I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't. I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about-anything-uncomfortable gene
"
," Ted: One last thing about my mom. She grills every single one of my girlfriends about when we're gonna get married and have kids.
"
," Ted: Doesn't matter. And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin Stacy: six kids in five years. The woman's basically a ride at a water park.
"
," Ted: You know what? You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions. You shouldn't have to apologize for them.
"
," Ted: I would.
"
," Ted: Oh, good for her.
"
," Ted: You lucked out with my mom last night, huh? What a relief, right?
"
," Ted: Hooray?
"
," Ted: Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important.
"
," Ted: They've been fighting lately. They're probably off somewhere going at it.
"
," Ted: I'm gonna kill him.
"
," Ted: Sweetheart? Sweetheart?! The only sweetheart in your life should be the woman you married 30 years ago, not the waitress at the bar last night and not this clumsy floozy! (To the waitress) I'm sorry, you're not a floozy. I'm upset, I don't know what I'm saying. But stay away from my dad.
"
," Ted: Dad? You, uh, want to tell Mom what happened at the bar last night?
"
," Ted: Oh?
"
," Ted: Serious talk? Mom, what...? He was kissing another woman. Don't you care?
"
," Ted: What do you mean you're divorced? Since when?
"
," Ted: So ten months ago, you just up and decided to get divorced without telling me?
"
," Ted: How could you not tell me this?!
"
," Ted: So last Christmas...?
"
," Ted: I got you a tandem bike.
"
," Ted: Who the hell is Frank?!
"
," Ted: Okay, my head's about to explode, and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles, so I am leaving. (He leaves, following by his parents and Gerald)
"
," Ted: Thank you.
"
," Ted: No, this is ridiculous! We have to start talking about stuff, and not just baseball.
"
," Ted: Against the Red Sox? Boy, that's a big win. No. No. No. We're not gonna blow past this. I mean, I don't even know who you people. I don't even know how you met.
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: That's it? That's what passes for communication in our family? Man, when I have kids, and I tell them how I met their mother, I'm gonna tell them everything, the whole damn story.
"
," Ted: I just, I don't... I don't understand. You seemed so happy. When I was growing up, you seemed so... What happened?
"
," Ted: So? Jeremy and I are like that. That doesn't mean anything.
"
," Ted: Leah and I have different views on families. We're not about to break up because of it.
"
," Ted: I know.
"
," Ted: Good. Good, I think it'll be really good for the family. By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't returned my last couple calls.
"
," Ted: No. No.
"
," Ted: You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.
"
," Ted: Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, ""Man is least himself when he talks...""
"
," Ted: Ah. You're right... ""No quoting Oscar Wilde.""
"
," Ted: How good was that movie?
"
," Ted: Uh, hi again. Ted. Oh, and, Jerry, you remember my girlfriend.
"
," Ted: There's Where?
"
," Ted: Not Okay. That place is lame.
"
," Ted: Where?
"
," Ted: Not Okay. Okay is lame.
"
," Ted: Not Okay!
"
," Ted: Hi! I'm Ted! Gary's boyfriend! Nice to meet you.
"
," Ted: Okay. ""I would have stolen you a whole orchestra."" There. What's the rush?
"
," Ted: Really? That guy? He was, like, a four.
"
," Ted: Hey! I'm not perfect; I'm an eight... and a half.
"
," Ted: Fine. Let's go talk to him. Where'd you meet this booger-eater anyway?
"
," Ted: Really? I remember that sale.
"
," Ted: Hey, Bob.
"
," Ted: Look what I just bought. Right? Right? (He is wearing the Red Boots)
"
," Ted: Hold on. We were dating then. I specifically remember, because we had great s*x that night. Great s*x.
"
," Ted: Let me guess. Someone wants to knock... boots. Boots. (imitating gunshots)
"
," Ted: All right.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: But I... I can't see, and you can't see me.
"
," Ted: You were picturing your crush!
"
," Ted: Okay, okay, answer me this. Are you absolutely sure it had nothing whatsoever... to do with the boots?
"
," Ted: Do you have these in a size 11?
"
," Ted: Hey! How's the open marriage going? Who was the first one to get the five numbers?
"
," Ted: Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's.
"
," Ted: Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's. You love that place, remember what a great time we had the last time we were there?
"
," Ted: Yeah, yeah. We had that crazy waiter who kept going, ""You two should get married! You two should get married!""
"
," Ted: Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining. It was so romantic? How can you not remember this?
"
," Ted: Oh, right! It was... my sister.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on. Remember when we went to see it? We sat in the back row.
"
," Ted:  That's right. I saw it with my sister.
"
," Ted: Oh, it's so romantic.
"
," Ted: I... went... with my sister.
"
," Ted: You're right. We should just be honest.
"
," Ted: See that girl over there? Three years ago, I totally made out with her.
"
," Ted: What? You said...
"
," Ted: Remember honesty...?
"
," Ted: Well, you're...confusing.
"
," Ted: Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us.
"
," Ted: So, earlier tonight...
"
," Ted: I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt.
"
," Ted: We're getting to it.
"
," Ted: Yeah, there's some in the bathroom. Got to moisturize! Got to keep that pretty face moist.
"
," Ted: What are you talking about? It's yours.
"
," Ted: Oh, well... then I guess it's Hazel's.
"
," Ted: Um, my sister's.
"
," Ted: Um... I love you.
"
," Ted: Thank you, Bryan. Thank you so much.
"
," Ted: I don't know. I just never threw it out.
"
," Ted: Yeah. I'm madly in love with her, and the only way I can deal with it is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion.
"
," Ted: Why is this such a big deal?
"
," Ted: Whoa, she wasn't a whore.
"
," Ted: Nothing. That's it. Well, except for the phone booth. And the lamp by the desk... and the...
"
," Ted: Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it.
"
," Ted: Yeah, like we did with Sharlene's pants.
"
," Ted: Sorry, buddy, it's a ""no"" for me, too. Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called. Even they don't want those pants back.
"
," Ted: Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal. I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano, I don't think of Jeannie Radford, I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe. And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses. I remember when I was broke, just out of college, and I really needed a lamp. And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein. I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there.
"
," Ted: Really? You can't look at a pillow without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow!
"
," Ted: You're creepy and gross.
"
," Ted: All right, Miguel. It all comes down to you.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Just stop, sweetie.
"
," Ted: Where do you guys want to sit?
"
," Ted: Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer.
"
," Ted: I know. He can be really insensitive.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God, it was so bad.
"
," Ted: Nope.
"
," Ted: What can I say? Papa gets swag.
"
," Ted: You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff. But seeing how happy it makes you - totally worth it.
"
," Ted: Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Well, sit. Sit, yeah. So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?
"
," Ted: So I had to get rid of everything from my past relationships because you don't keep things from your past relationships except, uh, where are your five dogs from? Oh, that's right: your past relationships.
"
," Ted: Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment, and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends?
"
," Ted: I do now.
"
," Ted: I thought you said you got rid of everything your ex-boyfriends gave you. Well, yeah, but not my dogs.
"
," Ted: You said everything.
"
," Ted: Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away.
"
," Ted: Enjoying this?
"
," Ted: Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you to make me get rid of all my stuff.
"
," Ted: Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs.
"
," Ted: Really? Well, I say we take it to the group, but I don't like your chances.
"
," Ted: I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them. That was ridiculous.
"
," Ted: Yeah, we're great.
"
," Ted: I gotta go.
"
," Ted: Where've you been? I called you earlier.
"
," Ted: You what?
"
," Ted: Wow. Oh, man.
"
," Ted: Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar.
"
," Ted: Um, the floors are gone.
"
," Ted: Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed. This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail.
"
," Ted: I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: You weren't there.
"
," Ted: Man, this guy's so rude.
"
," Ted: This is awesome.
"
," Ted: Your baby Fiero's grown into a really old man Fiero. And just like an old man, he leaks fluid, smells stale, makes weird noises out the back.
"
," Ted: Uh, Steve, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off, but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins.
"
," Ted: Whoa, pothole. The car stops.
"
," Ted: Is it cool if I still light these?
"
," Ted: Hey. One good thing: we're off the hook for the folding party today.
"
," Ted: Hey, your car's going to be fine. This is the best auto shop around. Look at this certificate. One of the mechanics here finished a 64-ounce steak.
"
," Ted: Terrific.
"
," Ted: She? I thought it was your little boy.
"
," Ted: And that is the origin of Jacqueline's insane ""no food or drinks in the Fiero, not even groceries"" rule.
"
," Ted: The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it. Remember the 100K fiasco?
"
," Ted: Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco.
"
," Ted: It was just before winter break our freshman year of college. Letitia and I were roommates, but we weren't really good friends yet.
"
," Ted: And Nevaeh was a total slob.
"
," Ted: All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio. I live in the moment. Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving. We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so...
"
," Ted: She'd be so bummed if I left early.
"
," Ted: It was totally mutual. I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I... it was... it was totally mutual.
"
," Ted: So what's up with you and Lynn? Anything serious
"
," Ted: So... this song.
"
," Ted: Maybe. I am so... sick... of this song.
"
," Ted: What do you mean?
"
," Ted: That was probably our best one. Hey, you want to play Zitch Dog?
"
," Ted: Uh, it's a car game. Every time you see a dog, you got to be the first one to say, ""Zitch dog."" I'm pretty good, so...
"
," Ted: Well, no, I didn't know we had...we'd started, but... Okay, that's cool. You got the first point.
"
," Ted: Zitch dog. Damn it!
"
," Ted: Are we still playing? 'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...
"
," Ted: Joseph. Joseph.
"
," Ted: Damn it!
"
," Ted: Hey, we got some time. What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know? Robert Frost.
"
," Ted: Too late. I'm taking this exit. Who's not fun enough now, Karen?
"
," Ted: No, keep driving.
"
," Ted: It's below zero out. If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days. Plus, I only have, like, six granola bars and three bottles of water.
"
," Ted: What?!
"
," Ted: No food or drink in the F...? You haven't washed your sheets since... (Voix off): Thus began the longest night of our lives.
"
," Ted: Lee... there's a very real chance that we're gonna be snowed in here for days. If I die first, do whatever you need to survive. Eat my flesh. Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever.
"
," Ted: What? I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me.
"
," Ted: But... but you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't.
"
," Ted: This is all because of your insane no-food rule.
"
," Ted: Hey! My spectacles! Hey. I know we're low on gas, but can we turn on the heat for just a minute?
"
," Ted: Come on, Jennie.
"
," Ted: That's okay. They were decorative. Hey, Wallace.
"
," Ted: Are you still thinking about Monica?
"
," Ted: Please stop.(voix off) And so Kelly and I thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere. But funny thing...
"
," Ted: Damn it!
"
," Ted: That trip is when Alberto and I became best friends.
"
," Ted: Well, it's a pretty old car.
"
," Ted: Let me tell it. It was last year during the transit strike.
"
," Ted: Hey.
"
," Ted: Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys.
"
," Ted: To Queens?
"
," Ted:Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so.
"
," Ted: Wait! You know how to drive, right?
"
," Ted: Which pedal's the gas?
"
," Ted: No, it's not
"
," Ted: No, it's not.
"
," Ted: Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Bernard Stinson, buckle up.
"
," Ted: Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.
"
," Ted: Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.
"
," Ted: Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.
"
," Ted: The left one.
"
," Ted: Make the Ls
"
," Ted: Why did you just turn on the radio?
"
," Ted: Relax. You're being crazy.
"
," Ted: Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!
"
," Ted: We're okay.
"
," Ted: Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he...
"
," Ted: You know what? This Fiero, it's effected all our lives.
"
," Ted: That's what I said.
"
," Ted: Wow! You guys are getting married in two months.
"
," Ted: Was it...?
"
," Ted: I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding, they were great.
"
," Ted: Yes, Manuel, my cousin, the drummer from Led Zeppelin, who died in 1980, got married two months ago.
"
," Ted: Oscar, you're being a wee bit intense about this band thing.
"
," Ted: Wow.
"
," Ted: You're getting on board with Clifford's idea? Man, you really have snapped.
"
," Ted: Hey, why don't we all go?
"
," Ted: Yeah, you're right. Besides, Lydia and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding. Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: Bye, have fun. See you.
"
," Ted: So, what, we ready for tonight?
"
," Ted: Shot of Jim Beam?
"
," Ted: Yes!
"
," Ted: What?!
"
," Ted: Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break. Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad, but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad.
"
," Ted: Do I look like I'm four? All right, what kind of prize are we talking?
"
," Ted: This is pathetic. It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights. If I got in a fight, would you have my back?
"
," Ted: I'd have your back, too.
"
," Ted: What, you don't think you'd need my help? You don't know what I can do. I'm like... like a berserker.
"
," Ted: Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame! I don't even want to go anyway.
"
," Ted: What'd she say? What'd she say?
"
," Ted: Okay.
"
," Ted: All right.
"
," Ted: We just snuck in the back.
"
," Ted: But you got in. Slow and steady won the race.
"
," Ted: Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus. You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here.
"
," Ted: Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so...
"
," Ted: Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome.
"
," Ted: You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly quick.
"
," Ted: So how was your first prom?
"
," Ted: So, basically, it was a prom.
"
," Ted: I'll take what I can get.
"
," Ted: I'm your bitch. Why this time?
"
," Ted: What's going on, did I just have a stroke?
"
," Ted: A friend of yours named you?
"
," Ted: Nice going, Scherbatsky. You're becoming a long and difficult-to-spell household name.
"
," Ted: Ever since then she's been signing him up for book clubs, cooking classes...
"
," Ted: So, no. Arthur and Rebecca will not be doing this.
"
," Ted: Kelly, who supposedly I'm gonna love?
"
," Ted: Okay, I guess I can take her off your hands for an evening.
"
," Ted: What, what, what...?
"
," Ted: Thank you.
"
," Ted: Alright, Tin-Man. Let's hit it.
"
," Ted: Alright, cool kids are leaving now. Grandma, grandpa... don't wait up.
"
," Ted: Do strategies ever work for you?
"
," Ted: This place seems great. Is Kelly here?
"
," Ted: Can we come?
"
," Ted: Whoa... this place in lourd!
"
," Ted: (Subtitle) You want to go somewhere we can talk?
"
," Ted: (Subtitle)...Okay...
"
," Ted: (Subtitle) So, how do you know Maxine?
"
," Ted: (Subtitle) Is that near Westchester?
"
," Ted: (Subtitle) ""14""?
"
," Ted: (Subtitle) ""7""?
"
," Ted: (Subtitle) You really like this place? (Kelly nods. Subtitle) You have no idea what I'm saying, do you? I'm from outer space! I got thrown out of Sea World for humping a dolphin! (Music stops. Ted yells) I'M WETTING MY PANTS. (Everyone stares at him. Music begins again)
"
," Ted: (Subtitle) I'm bailing, see ya.
"
," Ted: (Subtitle) Nice eyes. Cute smile. Out of your league.
"
," Ted: What are you doing here? Bertha let you go?
"
," Ted: You are so dead.
"
," Ted: Wow. Uh... I'm going home.
"
," Ted: Alright, one beer.
"
," Ted: (Subtitle) Come on, let's go. (Toni refuses)
"
," Ted: (Subtitle) There's Renee. I'm leaving. (Toni wobbles over to Renee)
"
," Ted: Yeah, these clubs are supposed to be fun, right? Why do I hate them so much?
"
," Ted: Or New Year's Eve.
"
," Ted: Or parades.
"
," Ted: Or parades.
"
," Ted: I really hate parades. (Laughs)
"
," Ted: Right.
"
," Ted: So, by that logic, if you and I were to, say, go out on a date.
"
," Ted: Right. The DMV it is.
"
," Ted: Sounds awful, it's a date.
"
," Ted: But there's still one big question that needs to be answered.
"
," Ted: How many of these coats do you think I could put on all at once?
"
," Ted: (Comes out wearing many coats) Martin.
"
," Ted: What? What happened to that, uh, cutlet you were grinding with?
"
," Ted: (laughs) What?!
"
," Ted: (Laughing) Alright, I promise. Let's get Timmothy and go, okay. (Takes coats off. To Coat Check Girl) Hey. Thanks for saving my night. I'll talk to you soon? Umm, hey... tip her, Karl.
"
," Ted: Funny story, Carmen was grinding with this girl all night...
"
," Ted: That's a handy new trick. (They run up to the dance floor)
"
," Ted: (Yelling) I'M REALLY GLAD YOU GUYS CAME OUT TONIGHT.
"
," Ted: I'M SORRY, I JUST ASSUMMED YOU...
"
," Ted: --HAD OTHER PLANS. I MEAN LATELY...
"
," Ted: YOU CRAZY? YOU THINK I LIKE GOING TO THOSE CLUBS? I'D SO MUCH RATHER GO TO YOUR FRUITY LITTLE WINE TASTING.
"
," Ted: PROBLEM IS... YOU CAN'T DO ANY OF THAT COUPLE STUFF UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO DO IT WITH. AND THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO FIND THAT SOMEONE IS BY GOING OUT DOING STUPID SINGLE STUFF WITH BARNEY.
"
," Ted: BUT MAN, WHEN I FIND HER. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME BADASS WINE TASTINGS.
"
," Ted: YEAH, MAYBE IT WILL BE.
"
," Ted: Hey, guys.
"
," Ted: I wish you could stay.
"
," Ted: Call you afterwards?
"
," Ted: Bye.
"
," Ted: Zero.
"
," Ted: Guys, we just met. And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick, so we talked about it, and we decided to take this one slow.
"
," Ted: Totally her idea! But, I don't know, I'm really into this girl, and if going slow is what it takes to make this happen, I say bring it on.
"
," Ted: I don't feel so good. t's like my testicles mixed pop rocks and soda.
"
," Ted: You've only had s*x with one girl in your whole life.
"
," Ted: Oh, I can't, I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.
"
," Ted: Really? Are you sure? Wow, that snuck up on me.
"
," Ted: The 18th can't get here fast enough.
"
," Ted: Oh. Well, um, we can just... wait until you get back. I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this.
"
," Ted: 75th and Amsterdam.
"
," Ted: I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend.
"
," Ted: No. Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting. By its very nature, it... slips through our fingers... making it that much more precious.
"
," Ted: Should we take this to the bedroom?
"
," Ted: Sure. Good luck with that. (He hangs up) Sorry about that.
"
," Ted: I'll get another bottle.
"
," Ted: Should we move to the bedroom?
"
," Ted: Sure. Good luck with that.
"
," Ted: Come on, guys, get a room.
"
," Ted: Friends, tonight is the night. I invite Tiffany home to see my collection of vintage cameras.
"
," Ted: As if she had to ""borrow a book"" or ""listen to old vinyl.""
"
," Ted: A mini pig? On which it would work?
"
," Ted: I can borrow your mini pig?
"
," Ted: You've always been so beautiful? You're going out on ""In high school I was super shy and I in my skin""?
"
," Ted: Seriously?
"
," Ted: You got a boyfriend?
"
," Ted: Okay.
"
," Ted: He is or not?
"
," Ted: Do you understand anything?
"
," Ted: Someone does not want to lose his Dark Brown.
"
," Ted: What? I am not to his hook.
"
," Ted: That's not the same with me and Tiffany. Listen.
"
," Ted: I will not give up.
"
," Ted: This girl is special.
"
," Ted: It will get better with Tiffany.
"
," Ted: There she is. (Between Tiffany followed by several other women) It has led to colleagues.
"
," Ted: Yep.
"
," Ted: How do you know?
"
," Ted: What? It's just a job.
"
," Ted: I will not say explicitly.
"
," Ted: Okay. In fact, you've dumped your loser of guy?
"
," Ted: She touched my nose.
"
," Ted: Friends, good news. Tiffany broke up with her boyfriend. So I'm not the hook.
"
," Ted: Look what we did yesterday.
"
," Ted: First, it was spoiled. Then we shared a chocolate cake.Then, well, I did not used to join the discussions of changing rooms, but I made her a foot massage... rather sensual.
"
," Ted: Well, no, but...
"
," Ted: It was a pre-made.
"
," Ted: I've never done that.
"
," Ted: Henrietta and I are just friends.
"
," Ted: Absolutely not.
"
," Ted: You amaze me that such an expert is to keep people on your hook. And this poor cameraman your job?
"
," Ted: Come on.
"
," Ted: You're Captain Hook.
"
," Ted: That's not why it's good.
"
," Ted: Henrietta knows we're just friends. In fact, I'll call and get away with it tonight, friends.
"
," Ted: No, that's fine.
"
," Ted: Hello?
"
," Ted: Hey Tiffany!
"
," Ted: I would love that. What are you doing here? Great. See you in 10 minutes. Super. Sorry, Henrietta, something unexpected.We redo it, my friend?
"
," Ted: It works, yeah.
"
," Ted: Champagne?
"
," Ted: Whatever it is, we can talk now.
"
," Ted: Now that I think a call would have been nice.
"
," Ted: You know what? That will not work between us... ever. I'm done. (He takes the jacket on the bed and hand) And that's really better for traffic if you weight the arch with your thumbs. Now I'm done.
"
," Ted: I'm done.
"
," Ted: It's worse.
"
," Ted: Yeah, there was a...
"
," Ted: Honestly, I thought to marry him just out of sheer embarrassment. But I did the right thing. I did what anyone who has someone should hook her. I would have broken my heart.
"
," Ted: Henrietta, I'm sorry if it's brutal but I think you duty. I do not wanna be with you.
"
," Ted: Ever.
"
," Ted: It was violent.
"
," Ted: You still broies black to the end of the era of the daughters of pharma?
"
," Ted: Face. Huh. That's your weirdest nickname for boobs yet.
"
," Ted: That's adorable. You're from Canada.
"
," Ted: I'd say you're not a real New Yorker until you've stolen a cab from someone who needs it more than you do.
"
," Ted: Well, the bus runs more often on weekends. Take the M-7 to the M-5.
"
," Ted: Dude, that's, like, seven miles. You can't do that. You can't beat the bus!
"
," Ted: All right, all right, hold on, hold on! Let's just forget about it. Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway. First person there wins! (Everyone stand up et run outside)Doesn't matter how you get there!
"
," Ted: Grademyteacher.net?
"
," Ted: Here's a fun fact. See the Alberta Building over there?
"
," Ted: That's the gray one. Did you know that in 18...
"
," Ted: Well, you're in luck. See that gothic church over there? Those corinthian columns were designed by Giuseppe Pegatto in 1896. (the woman stands up to find another place)
"
," Ted: See that over there? That's the old Arcadian Hotel. Fun fact... While today its neoclassical fenestration is considered to be... (the driver suddenly pulls the breaks)
"
," Ted: Uses a hybrid steel tube structure...
"
," Ted: Okay, this is clearly a sign. Let's just call it a tie. Forget about the race. Head back to the bar.
"
," Ted: And not a single passenger would listen to me. I mean, am I a bad teacher? Do I just put people to sleep?
"
," Ted: Wait. Is that what this whole stupid running thing has been about?
"
," Ted: Dude, you've been trying for two months, not two years. That's nothing.
"
," Ted: 64. But whatever.
"
," Ted: There it is.
"
," Ted: I know what you did back there.
"
," Ted: I'm not gonna... Not gonna...
"
," Ted: Marcus, you're on beer detail. Derrick, you're making the bean dip. Uh, Wade, you're on chips and pretzels, and Tony, I'm giving you nothing to do so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem.
"
," Ted: And I will be going to Quinn's to pick up the world's greatest food, the Super Bowl Hot Wings Platter.
"
," Ted: What's tomorrow night?
"
," Ted: Who was Mark?
"
," Ted: Okay, I feel terrible, but the truth is we didn't know Mike.
"
," Ted: Mark, and as long as we send flowers, I can't think of any reason we'd have to Carl (at the bar): Get out of here! I never want to see your face in this bar again! This soulless b*st*rd just told me he can't come to Mark's funeral because he wants to watch the Super Bowl. Could you believe that? You guys are coming, right?
"
," Ted: Okay, here's the plan: record the game, go to the funeral, pay our respects to Matt...
"
," Ted: Mark, and start watching only an hour late.
"
," Ted: Almighty TiVo, we thank you for all the gifts you have given us: the power to freeze live TV to go take a leak is nothing short of Godlike. Let's not forget fast-forwarding through commercials. It seems greedy to ask anything more from you, O magic box, but if you malfunction and miss the Super Bowl, we will destroy you in the
"
," Ted: Amen.
"
," Ted: Oh, come on. Remember last year? Who wants to watch a monkey in a coconut bra order a pizza?
"
," Ted: So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up?
"
," Ted: Virtually.
"
," Ted: Sartorial""?
"
," Ted: No, no, no, we can't! We have to watch the game together. It's tradition. Think of all the great times we've had watching this game.
"
," Ted: Second down, everyone drink.
"
," Ted: I love you guys. This is so great, all of us watching the Super Bowl together. This is special. We need to do this every year, promise me!
"
," Ted: Everyone drink!
"
," Ted: God, this is such a great tradition, all of us watching the game together. How did this start?
"
," Ted: God, how cool is Mitchell?
"
," Ted: Look, we always watch the Super Bowl together. So we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 6:00 and go the next 18 hours without finding out who won.
"
," Ted: I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy. That means no TV, no Internet, no newspapers, nothing. Media blackout. But our tradition lives on. Who's in?
"
," Ted: Dude, we're at a wake.
"
," Ted: What? No.
"
," Ted: Lots more, no.
"
," Ted: Fine. But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan and I think that's funny.
"
," Ted: Not until game time.
"
," Ted: Pick up the hot wings.
"
," Ted: Ah, don't worry. I got it all planned out. First of all: I placed duct tape on a pair of sunglasses so I can only see out of two tiny holes. Next, I constructed blinders out of an old cereal box. Top it all off: high-tech noise-reducing headphones I bought when Jeffrey and Calvin first got back together and were doing it a lot. I call it the Sensory Deprivator 5000.
"
," Ted: Hello! Uh, my name is Ted Mosby. I'm here to pick up my hot wings. In my hand, you'll find the exact total for the wings plus a generous tip. Please take the cash. Put the wings in my hand and I'll be on my way. Thank you!
"
," Ted: Ha! Who's the idiot now?! You said the Sensory Deprivator 5000 was stupid. But it totally worked! (barney leaves and Ted doesn't notice.) I couldn't see or hear anything happening around me. Right?! Right?! (He takes his glasses off) No...!
"
," Ted: Where's the dipping sauce?
"
," Ted: Hello! It's me again.
"
," Ted: Yeah, you forgot to give me the dipping sauce! Ah. Yes. This is the one.
"
," Ted: Yes...!
"
," Ted: Awesome. Just in time for kick-off. None of you guys found out the score, right?
"
," Ted: Great. Let's do it. I already fast-forwarded through the four hours of pre-game coverage. So we are ready. (Dylan comes in) Dylan, I can't even look at you. I don't want any sign of who won.
"
," Ted: Don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away. Feel free to start without me. Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! So much money! You screwed it up, Alfred! You screwed everything up! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Okay, let's watch the game.
"
," Ted: Patrick, what the hell was that? We know who you bet on. Now you've ruined the game for everyone.
"
," Ted: There's no point in even watching the game.
"
," Ted: Ah, what the hell. Let's watch Charlotte lose some money.
"
," Ted: I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000.
"
," Ted: 50-50, give or take.
"
," Ted: He decides his victim.
"
," Ted: And well, do not push too. People can be fragile. And sometimes, without even trying, you can tear someone's heart, and crush it in front of a roomful of 26 people and a teacher's assistant.
"
," Ted: Something bad happened. This was the first course of the semester...
"
," Ted: Jamie Adamic. Salvation. Brian Glow-atz. Glau-atz?Salvation. Well done. Add a false name on the call sheet, very original guys. You know, I expected a little maturity, coming from students like you, and frankly, more creative. I mean, seriously, what kind of fake name is Jen Coulin?
"
," Ted: Come on guys, you would have at least been able to make it sound right. Jen Coulin?
"
," Ted: What happened to classic? Sat Troulcu, Ted and Bill Oukoi, Maby Stoukette, Roland Cule, that's false names, but Jen Coulin?
"
," Ted: Jen Coulin!
"
," Ted: Come on, I wait, swing all your jokes about Jen Coulin.
"
," Ted: Have you finished?
"
," Ted: And this is the best friend I ever had.
"
," Ted: You share it? Your share forever.
"
," Ted: That's exactly what you are.
"
," Ted: How we came up with that?
"
," Ted: Our toothbrush?
"
," Ted: Jorge, 4 of 5 dentists have just vomited on.
"
," Ted: Yuck? Are you kidding? There is no one left to do...
"
," Ted: Jen has not come into being today.
"
," Ted: Jen Coulin.
"
," Ted: Yeah. When did you start doing that too?
"
," Ted: Yeah, but you always keep your toothbrush in the bathroom, which is, incidentally, also weird.
"
," Ted: No, there was a toothbrush in the bathroom, and it was mine.
"
," Ted: Finish me!
"
," Ted: Beer! Salvation.
"
," Ted: Like a charm. As all week.
"
," Ted: Why?
"
," Ted: I can not believe that Jared is going to get fired.
"
," Ted: No! You can not distract a man who is right... you know what.
"
," Ted: I'm going. He needs a brother. Hey buddy.
"
," Ted: Is everything okay?
"
," Ted: Anything you want. What's the matter?
"
," Ted: Let's see it. Already heated to perfection? The smashed out? Ok I will deal for Big Mac.
"
," Ted: What? Oh, it will try with the girl holding the burger there.
"
," Ted: Gertrude, why is that force him to face a problem that can not adjust will help?
"
," Ted: You're much ignored the problems of dental hygiene for a dozen years. And yet you seem to...
"
," Ted: Dale you called?
"
," Ted:... seriously guys.
"
," Ted: Hey, what are you doing here? Returns to the bar!
"
," Ted: Really?
"
," Ted: Great. What really happened?
"
," Ted: Now my students have taught me that Jen Coulin abandon my material.
"
," Ted: News from Dale?
"
," Ted: Wanda, what are you doing?
"
," Ted: His whole life is a call for help. But we do not mess with a man who is in the midst of a no...
"
," Ted: I can not believe that thou hast brought him bad luck.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God!
"
," Ted: Well, that's it. Harper's still got to 6.
"
," Ted: And this is true for a former Yankee. When I arrived here, I was the fourth date with a girl I loved a lot before I do the fly by Phil Rizzuto.
"
," Ted: It's the same thing for the Yankees.
"
," Ted: He is pinball.
"
," Ted: It was well played, well played, well played.
"
," Ted: Yeah, I got my first drop.
"
," Ted: Wait a minute. When we went out together, you borrow the toothbrush all the time.
"
," Ted: At the second she sits next to Swisher, we reach the end.
"
," Ted: Follow me. Hey, Nick Swisher! This guy and his wife share a toothbrush!
"
," Ted: And it's weird, right?
"
," Ted: You take a beer with a Yankee, if that's not cool!
"
," Ted: I already see myself in front of my children, trying to tell them when their uncle Holly kissed 7 chicks in a row.
"
," Ted: You send Wendy to say now? Go! It's good, I understood.Jen Coulin is a crap name, and it becomes increasingly shitty when it is repeated. Jen Coulin. Jen Coulin. Jen Coulin.
"
," Ted: Why would you even say that?! It's the most ridic...
"
," Ted: No, you did not ruin a marriage. Only reception.
"
," Ted: Lose the cast.
"
," Ted: Well, I have good news. As you know, I recently decided to start out and see the girls.
"
," Ted: Uh, yes. Salvation. I'm Ted.
"
," Ted: It was a completely random moment. The kind that you can create yourself... At least I thought.
"
," Ted: Oh, no. How have I landed on it? Salvation. Ted Mosby. (With another woman) I plead guilty. Salvation. Ted Mosby. (And another) It's embarrassing. I will be on the cover of ""An egg on my face"" magazine. But I'm not. I'm on the cover of that one. Salvation. Ted Mosby.
"
," Ted: completely random 16 times in one day, and 16 of these, 10 were single. Of these 10, seven have loved what they saw. Of these seven, four were women. And these four, two have given me their real number. And I go with both.
"
," Ted: I just had two rencards following. With two adorable girls, four cappuccinos and wait... (2 minutes later...) I do not know which was the best. Here are the girls: Jessica is a student in Rhode Island, she traveled around the world, speaks four languages and plays the piano. Claire and fought for the bill. So I do not know. It is torture. You see, the two girls have the potential to be really special. They both deserve a second round.
"
," Ted: Define ""serious"".
"
," Ted: So I can go to the second two with no problem?
"
," Ted: Of course.
"
," Ted: Oh my God. This is huge! I am invited to the Ball of Architects, the annual gala honoring the greatest architects of the city. Oh no. You guys see the problem?
"
," Ted: Don, this is the biggest celebrity event of the year. In taking a girl at the ball, man, you reached third base. Whatever the girl I invite, it will be the steady girlfriend of Ted Mosby by the end of the evening. Ok, we stop to sit between two chairs. Don, bring me my notebook. It's time to make lists of pros and cons.
"
," Ted: I can not choose. They are both extraordinary.
"
," Ted: Yes, yes, good idea. Let fate decide? I will choose the left.
"
," Ted: Uh, I have perhaps not been clear is the... Ellen Ball Architects.This event is a very hip.
"
," Ted: Lenny Kravitz.
"
," Ted: Yes. He is there every year. And it's a rock star.
"
," Ted: This list of pros and cons leads to nothing. I need a color scale.
"
," Ted: Ok, so the red bar indicates the level of attractiveness, blue, intellectual stimulation, green, emotional connection, yellow, compatibility aspirations of life, and purple, so she tried to pay or not.
"
," Ted: Do not fight in...
"
," Ted: What big event?
"
," Ted: His funeral? It fell into the water, he emerged miraculously from his coma.
"
," Ted: Pete has a small dick?
"
," Ted: That's what I want. Scarlett's feelings for Nora, I want to feel again. I do not want to choose between two girls. I want to be completely baba one of the two.
"
," Ted: The pleasure is mine. And you know, you might find it interesting.Some of these guys represent the history of New York.
"
," Ted: Right there. Leonard Kravitz, world-renowned architect. This guy is a star. He will make his famous reading of 90 minutes on the beams.
"
," Ted: Ok
"
," Ted: Morning, everyone! So, I had an idea for the atrium. Ready? Columns.
"
," Ted: I... I can't believe you knocked over my model.
"
," Ted: Did you see what he was wearing today? It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples.
"
," Ted: Hey, guys. What's so funny?
"
," Ted: Thanks.
"
," Ted: Oh, Constance... I just had a great idea.
"
," Ted: Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert. Just say you're sick.
"
," Ted: Sick, huh? Unbutton your shirt. Hmm... ""Foo Fighters."" Get back to work.
"
," Ted: Well, I was thinking...
"
," Ted: Why would you say that?
"
," Ted: Tony.
"
," Ted: Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss. So, I went to talk to the managing partner.
"
," Ted: Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project.
"
," Ted: Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear Mosby's doing some great work.
"
," Ted: Knock yourself out.
"
," Ted: You know what? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fire Druthers tomorrow.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: No.
"
," Ted: Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared.
"
," Ted: Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.
"
," Ted: This is a cocktail napkin. Covered in profanity. Look, Hammond, um, there's no easy way to say this, so... why don't we just, um, step into your office.
"
," Ted: I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised.
"
," Ted: Hey, that new dart is great.
"
," Ted:  Nude art.
"
," Ted: Field trip!
"
," Ted: One of my worst fears has come true-- I just saw Sharlene grabbing himself naked. Well, I gotta go. Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office.
"
," Ted: Hammond, is that you?
"
," Ted: Uh, no, I, I really need to talk to you. Look, there's no easy way to say... What, what are you doing?
"
," Ted: I'm standing here wearing pants. Are you sleeping here? What's going on?
"
," Ted: Okay, well, uh, you're right-- that is none of my business. Uh, look, there's no easy way to say this-- I...
"
," Ted: It's okay.
"
," Ted: Happy birthday, buddy. So, you've been living at the office?
"
," Ted: Yeah, I do.
"
," Ted: I see it.
"
," Ted: Not lost on me at all. But I don't understand, why don't you just go to a hotel? You could be sleeping on a mattress instead of... what appears to be torn-up drawings of my building.
"
," Ted: Uh, no, I don't.
"
," Ted: Well, that's the dream.
"
," Ted: Me too, Hammond.
"
," Ted: No, thanks.
"
," Ted: No, I think just Hammond.
"
," Ted: I was this close.
"
," Ted: That cabby would not shut up.
"
," Ted: I think it, you say it.
"
," Ted: Morning, team. So, I have given it some thought, and I say we revisit columns.
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Can I see you for one second?
"
," Ted: What are you doing? I thought we were friends. You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal. I tossed you more toilet paper.
"
," Ted: What? I don't believe this! You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes! And my
"
," Ted: No. Look, Hammond, there's no easy way to say this but...
"
," Ted: Oh, God.
"
," Ted: There is no easy way to say this, but...
"
," Ted: Believe me, there is no easy way to say this...
"
," Ted: You've got to be kidding me!
"
," Ted: Wait, his birthday was yesterday!
"
," Ted: No! No birthday! No! I got something to say and I'm gonna get it out. Hammond, listen to me. I am sorry that your dog died, and that your wife is divorcing you and that... your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday. And there is no easy way to say... What are you doing? What's going on?
"
," Ted: Oh, come on, you're not going to pull that, are you? Oh! Look, yeah, right. Now we're falling onto the ground. Well, nice try, but guess what? You're fired! You're fired, you get it? You hear me? You're gone! You're fired! (Mr Druthers is taken on a stretcher with an oxygen mask on his face.) In my defense, I think we all suspected Hammond might have been faking. On the plus side, the EMTs seem to think he's going to be just fine and, as you saw, they did admit that I did not cause the heart attack, even if they said it a bit begrudgingly.
"
," Ted: Gentlemen, I am a professor at this university and you are minor, so it is my duty to confiscate it, and that, and... the cooler?You know what, Boomer? You can keep it.
"
," Ted: And they will respond?
"
," Ted: Actually, it's really sexy.
"
," Ted: You go out with idiots cute?
"
," Ted: She wants to do a doctorate, she reads the philosophy for fun, she finished the crossword in the Sunday New York Times.
"
," Ted: To summarize, I have a date tonight. (We hear screaming outside) Thank you, New York! I try not to screw up.
"
," Ted: Would you jealous of the attention? Imagined would be the sexiest girl in the bar?
"
," Ted: How are you?
"
," Ted: It's cute.
"
," Ted: Sorry, I should not play with the affairs of your roommate.She look like?
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Why?
"
," Ted: Look at me. I promise, I would not fall in love with your roommate.
"
," Ted: It's strange.
"
," Ted: It's weird.
"
," Ted: Look, I am defeated. I hate it.
"
," Ted: I do not know why. You're great.
"
," Ted: Well, last night, it was nice today, less.
"
," Ted: It's not like if you followed my progress. It is not even in the same department.
"
," Ted: She exaggerates, there, right?
"
," Ted: Okay, I start again. She exaggerates, there, right?
"
," Ted: There is absolutely right.
"
," Ted: What if Cindy is the woman I am to marry, and I give up?Farewell, elegant but cozy house in Westchester, with a reasonable loan that I can pay without ruining me. Goodbye, the two children raised in a strict but loving hand, finding the perfect balance between the father and friend. Adios, triplets Schnauzers, Frank Lloyd Wright and. The fact is, I do not give up either! (Ted gets up and kissed the urn of Darryl before leaving) I do not know why I did that.
"
," Ted: Can we talk?
"
," Ted: I know the law prohibits us from going out together. But he also says ""Do not teach in having drunk"" and I do it all the time.The fact is... I really appreciate you. You're cute, funny. You write a thesis which is entitled, Foreign direct investment and intergenerational ties of consumption behavior. It's too sexy! I know it sounds crazy, but... I feel that our paths are supposed to meet, and... I do not want to miss meeting you.
"
," Ted: I gotta tell you, just by looking at your room, I know we have much in common.
"
," Ted: The Unicorns? Who will cut our hair When We're Gone? I thought I was the only one with this album.
"
," Ted: And that? After World T.C Boyle?
"
," Ted: You should. It is really good. And that? It is the height. You play the bass? Seriously, ask my friends. I have always said that my perfect woman... does not play bass, because that is clearly that of your roommate.
"
," Ted: Damn, that's cool.
"
," Ted: The group played shows your roommate or...?
"
," Ted: It's okay. We got hot dogs.
"
," Ted: Well, looks like someone's going out in the cold to get more ketchup.
"
," Ted: Which is all gone.
"
," Ted: Hmm, tell you what... no dice.
"
," Ted: You're not getting out of this.
"
," Ted: I'll get the ketchup.
"
," Ted: So are we ever gonna see you again? Because, if I recall correctly, you owe me a date with your hot cousin.
"
," Ted: Yes. And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.
"
," Ted: Hi, Honey, I'm Ted.
"
," Ted: What are you talking about?
"
," Ted: What?
"
," Ted: Mm-hmm.
"
," Ted: You're right. She's all yours, buddy. I'd say hump her brains out, but someone obviously already has.
"
," Ted: Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.
"
," Ted: Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.
"
," Ted: I'm in love with Zoey.
"
," Ted: I did. It's for me. This is about the coffee breath.
"
," Ted: It's because I'm in love with Zoey, and she's married, so it needs to stop. And... intervene.
"
," Ted: Remember the ketchup bottle? She wasn't the one who dropped it. When she reached for it, our fingers touched, and...(glass shatters) I knew, right in that moment, this isn't friendship. This is love.
"
," Ted: This is love. And this was my grandmother's watch. Anyway, now I have only one course of action in front of me: I have to end my friendship with Zoey.
"
," Ted: Then what am I supposed to do?
"
," Ted: Fine. I'll shut 'em down.
"
," Ted: Blah, blah, blah, I'm an architect. Blah, blah, blah, I don't wear suits. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
"
," Ted: Blah, blah, blah, blah. Rambling architecture anecdote. Blah, blah, something about a bridge. Blah, blah, blah...
"
," Ted: Hello.
"
," Ted: Yeah, yeah. I need to tell you something about Zoey, too.
"
," Ted: Can I get you a beer?
"
," Ted:Listen, Zoey, I, um... I need to tell you something. Um...
"
," Ted: I, uh... I can't be friends with you anymore. And this may seem strange, but... you can't ask me why.
"
," Ted: And that was it. No more Zoey.
"
," Ted: I, uh, I can't be friends with you anymore. And you can't ask me why.
"
," Ted: Sara hates you.
"
," Ted: Alma hates you. She hates you so much it's hard to be around you. So we can't be friends.
"
," Ted: I told you. Madison hates you.
"
," Ted: All right. Yes. I... hate you.
"
," Ted: Zoey.
"
," Ted: And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.
"
," Ted: Why do I hate you? Are you kidding? Uh, you're actively trying to prevent me from realizing a lifelong dream. So there's that. Plus, you're stubborn and-and-and argumentative. And what kind of name is Zoey, huh? What is that, short for Zoseph? (cell phone ringing) Go on, get it. I'll have more in a second.
"
," Ted: Why was Ryan calling?
"
," Ted: You talk during movies. You-You-You sneeze with your whole body. Uh, to my knowledge, you do not speak Portuguese.
"
," Ted: You're a show-off.
"
," Ted: Uh, hey, Leonard, can I call you back? I'm out in the hallway with... She is? She is? Leonard, I got to go.
"
," Ted: You are wrong. The ladies dig the professor look.
"
," Ted: No, you've just got to make it fun. For example, uh, every time I spot a grammatical error, I do a shot. I'm trashed right now, and I blame our public school system.
"
," Ted: Hey, how was the big couples' night with Isobel and Ava?
"
," Ted: Really? How?
"
," Ted: Let me guess: Did Vera get, like, super intense about the cheese?
"
," Ted: Poor Marie., Maureen's this gourmet cook, and all she letsMarie do ss pick out one sad block of cheese.
"
," Ted: Come on, they just got excited. They've been looking for couple best friends forever. Plus, I'm sure they weren't that bad.
"
," Ted: oh, that's not good.
"
," Ted: I don't understand. If last night went so horribly, why do Toni and Carrie think it was such a hit?
"
," Ted: They're your friends! Why would you just blatantly lie to them like that?
"
," Ted: Right?
"
," Ted: Oh, I don't want to brag, But it seems chicks are really digging the whole professor thing. Last night, she picked me up at the bar. And then... Well, she actually wound up falling asleep on the couch. But, hey, that happens.
"
," Ted: Sure, it does. You know, she was, she was just exhausted from being turned on. But you heard her. She wants to do it again, soon.
"
," Ted: Westchester. Why?
"
," Ted: What the hell is ""the sexless innkeeper""?
"
," Ted: Not really.
"
," Ted: Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?
"
," Ted: Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?
"
," Ted: No way.
"
," Ted: Guys, Megan and Gordon haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard.
"
," Ted: Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize.
"
," Ted: Arthur, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger.
"
," Ted: Thank you.
"
," Ted: For god's sake!
"
," Ted: Hey, guys.
"
," Ted: Max, are you wearing sweat pants?
"
," Ted: Okay, guys, I've got some bad news for you. So I'm just going to come out and say it. You're a couple. And no matter how hard you try to fight it, couples need other couples. That's why you miss Adam and Mia. And can't you just admit that?
"
," Ted: Hey, Dora. I got a little poem for you. You want to hear it?
"
," Ted: 'twas the night before, I had hours to kill. (the whole story is illustrated with images) I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill.
"
," Ted: Andrea. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said ""classy,"" but her eyes whispered ""sin."" She said, ""you're a teacher?"" I said, ""yes, indeed."" ""I must have you,"" she moaned.""I'm turned on by tweed."" With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper.
"
," Ted: God, I love being single.
"
," Ted: My first solo batch.
"
," Ted: Wait. Germany, Europe?
"
," Ted: So, this is the Europe Germany?
"
," Ted: The one in Epcot?
"
," Ted: Sorry. Congratulations.
"
," Ted: Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?
"
," Ted: Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.
"
," Ted: Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel...
"
," Ted: Monday, September the...?
"
," Ted: Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want. We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.
"
," Ted: Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option.
"
," Ted: Really? You?
"
," Ted: Yeah.
"
," Ted: Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point?
"
," Ted: Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.
"
," Ted: Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.
"
," Ted: All right. (He calls Victoria)
"
," Ted: Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?
"
," Ted: Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye. (He hungs up) She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all.
"
," Ted: So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go.
"
," Ted: I want you to stay.
"
," Ted: Hey, random question: how do you feel cats?
"
," Ted: I want you to stay.
"
," Ted: You're going?
"
," Ted: So that's what you decided?
"
," Ted: What is this, opposite day or something?
"
," Ted: So it is?
"
," Ted: I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are.
"
," Ted: Well, that's just crazy.
"
," Ted: But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.
"
," Ted: We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this.
"
," Ted: I guess so. I guess so.
"
," Ted: It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Alexis, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.
"
," Ted: She's leaving tomorrow.
"
," Ted: Yeah, she... she's still in town.
"
," Ted: Awesome air kicks, huh?
"
," Ted: You know it.
"
," Ted: So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.
"
," Ted: No, the leg is a metaphor.
"
," Ted: Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?
"
," Ted: Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.
"
," Ted: Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.
"
," Ted: Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?
"
," Ted: Yeah, big day.
"
," Ted: Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the s*x.
"
," Ted: I'm going to miss you, too.
"
," Ted: Even if we're not.
"
," Ted: Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?
"
," Ted: We can beat the odds.
"
," Ted: It's gonna work. We're going to make it work-- it'll work.
"
," Ted: Hey.
"
," Ted: They're happy.
"
," Ted: Even now, after all these years,
"
," Ted: Oh, my God, I've lost the ability to talk to girls without the Internet.
"
," Ted: Whoa.
"
," Ted: Get it together, Mosby.
"
," Ted: I gots to know!
"
," Ted: Well, anything sounds weird if you say it a hundred times. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.
"
," Ted: Bowl. Bowl.
"
," Ted: Bowl.
"
," Ted: Bowl.
"
," Ted: Bowl.
"
," Ted: Bowl.
"
," Ted: Bowl.
"
," Ted: Bowl. Bowl.
"
," Ted: Bowl.
"
," Ted: Bowl. Bowl.
"
," Ted: (at various pitches) Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.
"
," Ted: Bowl.
"
," Ted: Bowl
"
," Ted: Bowl. Bowl.
"
," Ted: Bowl?
"
," Ted: And she meant it. Trust me. I dated Myrtle for a year-- if you don't want to lose her, you gotta try a little harder. Be more attentive to where she is emotionally. You know, just be present.
"
," Ted: Mm-hmm.
"
," Ted: Welcome to Ruben 101.
"
," Ted: Why, I mean, there's just so much you need to know about her. Okay, for starters, don't ever cry in front her.
"
," Ted: And whatever you do, don't cry in front of her four times.
"
," Ted:  ""How To Date Olivia Scherbatsky."" Lesson one. Now, even though she puts up a tough exterior, what Olivia really wants, deep down...
"
," Ted: You said you wanted my help.
"
," Ted: We did that ready.
"
," Ted: No. Look, I need this, too. I've only been a professor a few weeks. Being up here, it's, it's good practice for me.
"
," Ted: No! What Tristan really wants deep down...
"
," Ted: Darren!
"
," Ted: Wow, you were just, like, the worst student in the world, weren't you?
"
," Ted: Regina, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up. I love you and I love Lester. And I want to make this work. So if you give me a few weeks of attention, I could give you a lifetime of happiness. Can you do that for me?
"
," Ted: Now, notice the vacant eyes, the pale, queasy expression, suggesting nausea. What do these mean?
"
," Ted: Dude! I worked really hard on these slides, okay? Can we just...
"
," Ted: This look is hunger. If you ever see Sophia looking like this, get some food in her quick,or one of two things will happen. One: weird, out-of-context laughter. (changing the photo) Or two: spontaneously falling to sleep in strange places. But the most important facial expression of all?
"
," Ted: Oh... (chuckling) That's for my class. TheFlatironBuilding. Fun story about it. It was designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style; this architectural gem...
"
," Ted: Right. The most important facial expression of all.
"
," Ted: Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. If you ever, ever see this face, Wanda, run. And don't take a picture of it. She will punch you. And you will cry... for the third time... that night. Which brings us to an important point: defusing the bomb.
"
," Ted: One. ""Vancouver Canucks 2004 Division Title.""
"
," Ted: Two: ""Proper Gun Cleaning and Maintenance.""
"
," Ted: Three: ""Emperor Penguins.""
"
," Ted: Now, we all know Roger's not what you'd call ""touchy-feely."" She doesn't say, ""I love you,"" like a normal person. Instead, she'll laugh, shake her head, give you a little smile and say, ""You're an idiot.""
"
," Ted: Yup. If she tells you you're an idiot, you're a lucky man. And if she does say ""I love you,"" she's already broken up with you in her mind.
"
," Ted: ""Theodore Scherbatsky's Surprising Erogenous Zones."" Right knee-- ticklish. Left knee...
"
," Ted: Does lefty like that?
"
," Ted: Oh, yeah...lefty like that.
"
," Ted: Three: ""Never, ever play the 'Guess Who' game with her.""
"
," Ted: (arriving behind James and putting his hands over her eyes) Guess who?
"
," Ted: (afraid) It's me! It's me! It's me!
"
," Ted: Number four: ""Unless you want to see it 80 times a day, for the next month, never show Kathy a YouTube clip of an animal playing a musical instrument.""
"
," Ted: Jeremy! Do you have a problem with this class?
"
," Ted: Uh, well, maybe the problem is your attitude. You're not listening to a word I say.
"
," Ted: Oh, you think you're not learning anything, huh? Okay. Pop quiz.
"
," Ted: When Maurice's PMS-ing, what kind of chocolate should you get her?
"
," Ted: Correct! Why?
"
," Ted: Correct! What is Gavin's dream job?
"
," Ted: Correct! And if she achieves that, will she truly be happy?
"
," Ted: Yes! But I guess you're right. You haven't learned anything. Sorry to have wasted your time.
"
," Ted: How good was Dead Poet's Society?
"
," Ted: Now, as you can see, well over 50% of the blankets have been dragged onto her side. Make no mistake. Nevaeh Scherbatsky is a classic, textbook... cover hog. Any questions?
"
," Ted: Yes, Same?
"
," Ted: (to barney) Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. Uh-oh.
"
," Ted: Aw! You're giving Mabel away?
"
," Ted: Oh, that's Shin-Ya. He's sort of been auditing the class.
"
," Ted: Well, tried to explain to him it wasn't a real class, but I don't think he speaks much English.
"
," Ted: Uh, really? Name one wrong thing.
"
," Ted: Does lefty like that?
"
," Ted: Don't wanna leave out the righty.
"
," Ted: Noted.
"
," Ted: That was a lie?
"
," Ted: Look. All that stuff I told Krin... It was personal between you and me. I'm really sorry.
"
," Ted: It's funny. When you date someone, it's like you're taking one long course in who that person is and then, when you break up, all that stuff becomes useless. It's the emotional equivalent of an English degree. I guess I just liked the idea of putting all my Kristen Scherbatsky knowledge to good use, you know?
"
," Ted: I don't know. I will say this, though. I've seen Stephanie work very hard to get women. I've seen him work very hard to get rid of women. I've never seen him work this hard to keep one around. I was going to give him an A. Well, B+ -- Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve.
"
," Ted: Designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style, this architectural gem was the first of its kind...
"
," Ted: Yes, Susan?
"
," Ted: Right. That-That... was Daniel Burnham's wife. She was a troubled, troubled woman. We are moving on.
"
," Ted: Oh my God. Johnny...oh my God.
"
," Ted: OK. Lawrence, I'm about to go for the belt.
"
," Ted: The belt.
"
," Ted: All right, I'm ready, let's hit it.
"
," Ted: What? We agreed, I suited up.
"
," Ted: What are you talking about? I got the low-maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look.
"
," Ted: Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not?
"
," Ted: Really?
"
," Ted: All right, going down to the bar and ordering three beers, I'll see you in five minutes.
"
," Ted: (holding up appropriate number of fingers) 3 beers, 5 minutes.
"
," Ted: All right, the beers are here.
"
," Ted: Oh come on, we agreed...Did Candice take his pants off?
"
," Ted: Fine, I don't need friends. I got you guys. You guys are my friends, my cold refreshing friends. I'm talking to beer.
"
," Ted: Trudy. Oh my God, I haven't seen you since...
"
," Ted: That was you? Kidding. I was super wasted... that night. These are not all for me.
"
," Ted: No, I was gonna call you but I was so embarrassed.
"
," Ted: Those were yours? I thought they felt kinda tight. Kidding, I don't wear underwear, ladies underwear. Often. Again, I'm kidding.
"
," Ted: I know, do you wanna get a...
"
," Ted: Let me guess, you guys met in prison.
"
," Ted: Well, beers, what do you want to do? Stay here, or I know this other place called my belly.
"
," Ted: Oh, that's cool, I was gonna get outta here anyway, I'm really tired.
"
," Ted: Tired of people who fold early 'cause I am wide awake.
