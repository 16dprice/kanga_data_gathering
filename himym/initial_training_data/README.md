The data in this folder was used at first for training initial Robin and Ted models. I started off without using any validation data to see if we could actually get any decent results. It ended up being that (unsurprisingly) the models with validation _seemed_ to behave more like what we hoped/expected. Of course, none of these models have been rigorously evaluated with any metric though.
