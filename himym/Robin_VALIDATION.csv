"," Robin: ""Robin Scherbatsky's Surprising Erogenous Zones""? Let me clear something up for you, Ted.
"
" Ted: Does lefty like that?
"," Robin:  (embarassed) Oh. Yeah...
"
" Ted: Don't wanna leave out the righty.
"," Robin: Oh, uh, no. Um, the right one's ticklish, I guess. But the left one, yeah, I'm glad you're back there. Because that is just some sweet, sweet lovin'.
"
" Ted: That was a lie?
"," Robin: We had just started dating. I was being nice.
"
" Barney laughs
"," Robin: (to Barney) And you. You know, I got it into my head this week that you were cheating on me. I even broke open your briefcase to look for evidence.
"
" Barney: That is a huge violation of my privacy! Go on.
"," Robin: You know, in a way, I was right. You cheated. You can't get some crib sheet on dating me. That's not how it works. If we didn't figure out how to be with each other in a real, honest way, I don't see the point of even trying.
"
" Robin is sitting alone when Ted is arriving.
"," Robin: What do you want?
"
" Ted: Look. All that stuff I told Barney... It was personal between you and me. I'm really sorry.
"," Robin: I guess I'm impressed by how much you remembered.
"
" Ted: It's funny. When you date someone, it's like you're taking one long course in who that person is and then, when you break up, all that stuff becomes useless. It's the emotional equivalent of an English degree. I guess I just liked the idea of putting all my Robin Scherbatsky knowledge to good use, you know?
"," Robin: Well, since you know me pretty well... am I fooling myself with this whole Barney thing?
"
" boobs, medium boobs, some boobs that were big, but kind of in a bad way. The point is-- boobs that pointed in opposite direc--the point is...I'm really scared that you're going to dump me and that's why I did this and I'm sorry.
"," Robin: You're an idiot.
"
" She kisses him.
"," Robin: You know...
"
" Barney: Hmm?
"," Robin: That notebook, um, does contain a lot of personal info, and I think it has my home address.
"
" (Ted leaves, Marshall and Barney make strange finger movements mocking Ted's; Lily and Robin enter living room area from Lily's bedroom)
"," Robin: Thanks for lending me these boots. Where did you get them from?
"
" Lily: You look fantastic in them, Robin. But don't you think they're a little high for that dress?
"," Robin: Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've begun a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave.
"
" (Robin on date, flipping her hair)
"," Robin: That is so fascinating. So what happened?
"
" Robin's date: Well, after eighteen hours of surgery, I closed and thankfully both girls just celebrated their second birthday.
"," Robin: Wow, gosh, separating conjoined twins. That must be the most amazing feeling.
"

"
" (Robin on phone)
"," Robin: Lily, I have pounded three cappuccinos waiting for you. Pretty soon I won't have to shave, the hair is going to vibrate off my legs.
"
" (Robin on phone)
"," Robin: Lily, he can't see my legs like this. I look like a Turkish lesbian
"
" (Robin hangs up phone, waitress comes over to her table)
"," Robin: There is a pharmacy across the street. Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?
"
" (Waitress stands at Robin's table, Robin looks through brown paper bag)
"," Robin: Where's the shaving cream?
"
" Waitress: Well, you didn't ask me for shaving cream.
"," Robin: Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream?
"
" Waitress: Well, who doesn't shave their legs for her date?
"," Robin: Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude?
"
" Robin's date: Hey Robin, the valet's brought the car around. I thought we'd go back to my place. You in the mood for a night cap?
"," Robin: Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies room. I've got TB...tiny bladder. I'll meet you out front?
"
" (Robin walks into the ladies room, puts her purse down on the sink counter and takes out the razor from her bag, Robin props her right foot on the counter and unzips her boot, grabs the soap and pumps it but no soap comes out)
"," Robin: You've gotta be kidding me.
"
" (Robin walks out into the restaurant with her right boot still down, grabs the butter from the nearest table)
"," Robin: Excuse me.
"
" (Robin runs out of ladies room)
"," Robin: I'm here, I'm fine, my head is bleeding. Going down again.
"
" Lily: You have feelings for Ted.
"," Robin: Maybe.
"
" Victoria: Yes.
"," Robin: ""This long-distance thing sucks, huh? And I really need to talk to you tonight.""
"
" Ted: She's going to dump me!
"," Robin: She's not going to break up with you, Ted.
"
" Ted: Hello?
"," Robin: Do you want to come over?
"
" Ted: Hello.
"," Robin: Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over?
"
" Ted from 2030: Let's back up a little bit.
"," Robin: Sit. Good boys. Okay, remember, stay out of the liquor cabinet. I'll see you tonight.
"
" In Lily's class
"," Robin: And so the life of a television reporter is very rewarding, and I stronly urge you to consider it as a career. Thank you. Yeah?
"
" Lily: Marshall was here yesterday. They just learned the word ""fiancé.""
"," Robin: Oh, no, I don't have a fiancé.
"
" Little Girl: Then who do you live with?
"," Robin: Well, actually, I've got five dogs.
"
" Little Girl: Don't you get lonely?
"," Robin: No, I've got five dogs.
"
" Little Girl: My grandma has five cats and she gets lonely.
"," Robin: Well, yeah, that's cats. I'm not some pathetic cat lady. Not that your grandmother is...

" Robin: Well, yeah, that's cats. I'm not some pathetic cat lady. Not that your grandmother is...
"," Robin: Does anyone else have a...? Yes?
"
" Little Boy: Are you a lesbian?
"," Robin: No. Are you? Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les...
"
" Barney: So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks? 'Cause I just saw one. What up? Tiny five.
"," Robin: Ha-ha. Laugh now, those kids are monsters. They're going to eat you alive.

" [FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: Hello.
"
" Ted: Why hasn't she called yet?
"," Robin: Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.
"
" Ted: What's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.
"," Robin: I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.
"
" Man: So, Scherbotsky, got a boyfriend?
"," Robin: No, and why does this keep coming up today?
"
" Man: Oh, I just thought that guy you were on the phone with...
"," Robin: What? Oh, no, that was Ted. He's just a friend. I mean, there was this moment where we almost dated, but we want completely different things. Anyway, now he has this girlfriend in Germany and he thinks she's calling to dump him tonight, but I don't think she is. And besides, we want completely different things.
"
" Man: We should have s*x.
"," Robin: What?
"
" Man: Why not? We're both available, we're both attractive, we're both good at it. At least, I'm good at it. And even if you're not, don't worry, I'll have a good time either way.
"," Robin: Well, moving past the horrifying image of your hair helmet clanging against the headboard, don't get involved with people I work with.
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: Hey, guys. Miss me? I missed you, too. Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over? Ted?
"
" Ted: Uh, yeah... Uh, hi, I'm here.
"," Robin: Do you want to come over?
"
" Ted: Why? What's up?
"," Robin: Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like, ""You know who likes juice? Ted.""
"
" Ted: I love juice.
"," Robin: Great. So you want to come over and make juice?
"
" Ted: Okay, sure. I'll come over. We'll... juice.
"," Robin: Yes, we'll juice.

" Ted: Okay.
"," Robin: Okay... bye.
"
" Ted: You know, if you had just called me, I...
"," Robin: Hi.
"
" Ted: Hi. Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets.

"
" Ted: Wine... not? Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
"," Robin: Thanks.
"
" Ted: Make it a big glass.
"," Robin: Sure.
"
" Ted: So, how's it hanging?
"," Robin: Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore or what the hell you're doing with your life? Do you ever have one of those days?
"
" Ted: Uh, about once a week.
"," Robin: I don't know, it was just a, a rough day and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you. So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?
"
" Ted: We broke up.
"," Robin: What?
"
" Ted: Yeah. Yeah, she finally called. We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is-- and then... she dumped me.
"," Robin: Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful.
"
" Ted: You're smiling.
"," Robin: Am I? No I'm not. I'm a news anchor. Smiling's a part of the job. Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today. See? You're smiling, too.
"
" Ted: So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look.
"," Robin: Oh, yeah. Do you like it?
"
" (Ted's phone starts rigging)

"," Robin: Yeah?

" Ted: Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.
"," Robin: Okay.
"
" (He goes back to the livingroom; Robin's on the phone)
"," Robin: Okay. Bye. (She hungs up) I thought it was mine, so I answered it.
"
" Ted: Was it...?
"," Robin: It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.
"
" Marshall: Well, I mean, geez, Lily.
"," Robin: Well, whatever you do, do not name your baby ""Becky,"" right?
"
" Marshall: Why? What?
"," Robin: Becky. My new co-anchor? Don't you guys ever watch the show?
"
" [FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: Peace talks in the region have been described as, ""productive."" Becky?

"," Robin: Becky, we're-we're journalists. We can't get emotional about the news, we...
"
" Becky: Oh, no! They stole all his money and then pelted him with his own taco meat! Who would do that?
"," Robin: Well, if you read the story, we might find out.
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky?
"
" Ted: Mmm... (muttering) I thought she was charming.
"," Robin: You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men?
"
" Marshall: No, it's not. It's fun. Here, watch this. Hey, Lily... Who's your daddy?
"," Robin: Okay, uh, let me get this straight. So, in, uh, in this scenario, because you make such sweet love to Lily, she is now your daughter.
"
" Ted: Wow. That is disgusting.
"," Robin: Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy.

" Barney: Challenge accepted.

" Robin's work place
"," Robin: Members of the G-8 convened today in Vienna to discuss plans to fight climate change by re... What?

"
" Becky: Lighten up, Robin. (in baby voice): What'd you do, sweetheart?
"," Robin: Mike!
"
" Becky: Well, I'm new in town and don't know many people. But yesterday, I met the sweetest man, who took me on a tour of the city. (whispering) Guys, New York is kind of cool.
"," Robin: Okay, back to the G-8 conference. Hello? Mike, can I get in the shot? Fantastic.
"
" Becky: Then this cutie patootie took me to this bar called MacLaren's, right underneath his apartment.
"," Robin:Wait-- did you go out with Ted Mosby?
"
" Becky: Yes! Guys, I went out with Robin's roommate. I saw her bedroom. (whispering) She's a messy Bessie.
"," Robin:In other news, later today, a Manhattan architect gets punched in the throat.
"
" Ted: Ow!
"," Robin: Ted, of all the women in New York, you had to go out with an eight-year-old girl?
"
" Ted: Not what it sounds like, folks.
"," Robin: Ted, you know that I hate her. How could you go out on a date with this girl?
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: Let me guess: she acted like a helpless little girl, and you stepped in as the big, strong man.
"
" Ted: Then I held her tight and told her it was all gonna be okay. By the way, I think I only wounded the spider. It crawled off into my bedroom.
"," Robin: Wait. Is that why you slept on the couch last night?
"
" Barney: (little boy voice) Hey, want to have a three-way with me and my imaginary friend? His name's Otis. Hey, hey, want to come to my house and play telephone? I got the string; you got the cans. (giggles) I wet myself! Will you change me? Can't blame her on that one. Guys... I have some terrible, terrible news. I, Barney Stinson, can't pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy. Challenge forfeited.
"," Robin: Yeah, we don't care about this...
"
" Ted: Wow, I'm glad that's over. It was creepy watching Barney talk like a little kid.
"," Robin: Oh, but you find it irresistible when Becky does? I don't get it. The Ted that I went out with was attracted to the kind of woman who could use a steak knife without supervision.
"
" Ted: For your information, Becky doesn't like steak, she likes pasghetti. Spaghetti. And more importantly, she makes me feel needed.
"," Robin: Needed? (scoffs) She makes training wheels feel needed.
"
" The Bar
"," Robin: When we were dating, I... I didn't make you feel needed?
"
" (Ted takes the pizza and is going to pay for it when Robin arrives)
"," Robin: I got this.

" Ted: This okay? Am I hurting y...
"," Robin: I got this. Whoa!
"
" (Robin comes out of the room, a gun in her hand)
"," Robin: I got this.
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: Did that really bother you?
"
" Ted: Well, yeah. It's nice to be needed. Look, I'm sorry. (phone chimes) I didn't mean to upset you. It's Becky. Aw, she's trapped in a revolving door.
"," Robin: I got this.
"
" Robin is at Barney's door
"," Robin: Hey.
"
" Barney: Hey.
"," Robin: Hey. Um, when we were dating, did... did I make you feel needed?
"
" Barney: No, I didn't feel like you needed me at all.
"," Robin: That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry.
"
" Barney: Wait, where are you... That's a compliment. You are the least needy woman I've ever met-- that's awesome. I mean, no guy's gonna say ""Who's your daddy?"" to Robin Scherbatsky. You're your own daddy. And mommy. And weird survivalist uncle who lives in a cabin with a shotgun blaming stuff on the government. And that is what makes you the most... amazing, strong... independent woman I've ever banged.
"," Robin: Thanks, Barney. You know, um... there's something that I wanted to ask you, and I don't really know how to say it so... here goes. Who's the crazy chick in the apron?
"
" Barney: Challenge completed! (chuckles) Now, uh, can you get this freak out of here? I'm really scared.
"," Robin: I got this.
"
" Ted: What? There's no stigma anymore.
"," Robin: Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore.
"
" Ted: She's not even on the hot-crazy scale. She's just hot.
"," Robin: Wait, hot-crazy scale?
"
" (back from commercial break) Blah-blah: So, we know how Marshall and Lily met. Robin, how did you and Barney meet?
"," Robin: No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Barney and I are not together. No. No.

" Blah-blah: So, you're single.
"," Robin: Yeah.
"

"," Robin: College, good times.
"
" Blah-blah: These have sold in Japan. Robin, have you ever sold anything in Japan?
"," Robin: Uh, no, but I would love to buy one of them if... Where can I get one?
"
" Blah-blah: I don't have a distributor here yet, but thanks for rubbing that in. Why are you trying to undermine me in front of Ted?
"," Robin: Look, there's nothing going on between me and Ted.
"
" Blah-blah: Wow, that just came out of nowhere.
"," Robin: No, I'm just saying you don't have anything to worry about.
"
" Blah-blah: I wasn't worried. Are you saying I should be?
"," Robin: No, I'm saying that you shouldn't be.
"
" Blah-blah: Wait, you guys dated. For how long?
"," Robin: A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about s*x, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?
"
" Lily: Hey, man.
"," Robin: You wanna hang out?
"
" End flashback
"," Robin: Yeah man, you've been a rock.
"
" Ted: It is between the 44th and Lex. Impossible.

"," Robin: Who is Gazeur?
"
" Barney: Lily, you're all been there. When we loose one, it's not pretty.
"," Robin: You did what?
"
" Lily: It made me always feel guilty. But if Gazeur... Michael...came now, as hard as it may be, I would go to Gazeur...Michael... and I should settle things between us.
"," Robin: Clearing the air, as before. Oh, man. It does not happen often. You are welcome.

"," Robin: Who is Becca Delucci?
"
" Marshall: It comes back. (They go back under the table) We all think that you need... Wait, where is Barney? (Barney is in the next table) We think you should talk to him.

"," Robin: If the last person I wanted to see, came in I would not talk to him.
"
" Lily: Who is it?
"," Robin: My father.

"," Robin: The worst moment came in my 14 years. My junior hockey team had just won the ""Squamish Invitational."" And everybody came to my house to celebrate.
"
" Boy: I can not believe you hast missed the last shot, silly.
"," Robin: You're an idiot.
"
" Marshall: It's sad for your father, Robin, but congratulations for this game.
"," Robin: And Kyle and I are doing anything serious. It was only the blue line.
"
" Barney: The blue line?
"," Robin: You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that ""crease"" speaks for itself. After that, my relationship with my father has cooled. I moved with my mother, let my hair grow, was a Canadian pop star. Young normal stuff.
"
" Lily: You do not think you'd feel better if you talked to him?
"," Robin: That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what? ""I wish not to be raised as a boy, that thou teach me not to hunt, fish and smoke cigars and drinking scotch because girls do not do that. And you know why I run like a girl? Because I am one. ""
"
" Ted: You kept it for quite some time, eh?
"," Robin: Yes.

"," Robin: I understand!

"," Robin: Why take it away to bring him back in New Jersey, anyway?
"
" Marshall: Yes, Ted. Come on, buddy!
"," Robin: Get rid of your demons!
"
" Lily and Robin enter in a house...
"," Robin: Wow, it's beautiful, Lily.
"
" Barney: And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.
"," Robin: But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?
"
" Lily: Great. Now my mom's making me invite the Lessners. This puts our numbers in the triple digits.
"," Robin: Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more.
"
" Andrea: Yeah.
"," Robin: How do you play the harp with your belly so...?
"
" Andrea: Oh, I don't really-- I can only reach about half the strings.
"," Robin: You only play half the harp?
"
" Andrea: Yeah.
"," Robin: Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn?
"
" Andrea: I've been studying the harp for 12 years.
"," Robin: Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of ""Guitar Hero""? Learned that in a day. Is there a ""Harp Hero""?
"
" 1 hour and 38 minutes before the wedding...
"," Robin: Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony.
"
" Barney: Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? ""Hey, baby, want to pluck?""
"," Robin: Really? That didn't work.
"
" Lily: That's Scooter.
"," Robin: Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?
"
" Lily: His real name is Bill. My mom must have invited him.
"," Robin: Why? Why would she do that?
"
" Scooter: Maybe my words won't change your mind, but maybe the words of a poet will. I read from ""November Rain."" By W. Axl Rose.
"," Robin: That is a good song.
"
" Brad: What's up with Bill?
"," Robin: That's Scooter.
"
" 40 minutes before the wedding, in Lily's wearing her dress...
"," Robin: Oh, wow.
"
" Lily: Oh. Robin... My makeup looks perfect right now, and I'm about to cry. Do something.
"," Robin: I have hairy nipples.
"
" Lily: Really?
"," Robin: No, but it worked, didn't it?
"
" Brad: Hey. Funny story. I tackled this guy I thought was Scooter. Turns out it was your photographer. Don't worry. I got this sweet camera phone, so we're covered.
"," Robin: There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call...
"
" Lily: Totally cool.
"," Robin: Oh, no. Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry.
"
" Lily: Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on.
"," Robin: Are you sure?
"
" Lily: I'm marrying Marshall today. So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil in a room that has no flowers to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning, as my high school boyfriend reads Guns N' Roses lyrics. But that's okay, because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway.
"," Robin: Lily, are you okay?
"
" Lily: What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay! Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has! It's ruined!
"," Robin: What happened to ""I don't want a perfect wedding""?
"
" Lily: Oh, grow up, Robin! Of course I want a perfect wedding! Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but... I do. I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today.
"," Robin: And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better.
"
" Marshall: Lily, you're not supposed to see me.
"," Robin: Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you.
"
" Marshall: Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there?
"," Robin: Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here.
"
" Barney: Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other.
"," Robin: He's gonna cry.
"
" Lily: My turn. Oh, thank you. Marshall, I love you because you're funny and you make me feel loved and you make me feel safe and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says, ""Lily and Marshall. Rockin' It Since '96."" I kinda wish I was wearing it right now 'cause it smells like you. But the main reason I love you, Marshall Ericksen, is you make me happy. You make me happy all the time.

"," Robin: So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.
"
" Barney: I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.
"," Robin: Not according to her.
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: How is that a disaster?
"
" Barney: It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids.
"," Robin: Please, Cheese. You like this girl.
"
" Barney: What? Nora? No, I don't.
"," Robin: Barney, you can't say her name without smiling.
"
" Barney: That's... Nora. Sorry, sorry. I was thinking of a funny thing that Nora said. Hmm. Stop it. No... ra. Nah... Damn it, what is the matter with me?
"," Robin: You like her. You should call her.
"
" Barney: Call her? she had a nice face, her booty was in place, but Barney don't chase.
"," Robin: That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice.
"
" Lily: Yeah, he's been really... quiet.
"," Robin: Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man.
"
" Lily: Yeah, I'll walk out with you guys.
"," Robin: Good night. Good night, guys.
"
" Barney: 18 weeks.
"," Robin: Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and...
"
" Barney: Shh. Child, listen. If you're really hurting for it, I'd be more than happy to throw you one.
"," Robin: Throw me one? Yeah.
"
" Barney: We're exes. We're probably due for a backslide. Or we could just do it the normal way.
"," Robin: Oh, I see what's going on.
"
" Barney: Yeah?
"," Robin: This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your shot. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care.
"
" Barney: Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my shot?
"," Robin: Nora met a guy. What?!
"
" Barney: What?
"," Robin: Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.
"
" Marshall: Garbage Island. You haven't heard of Garbage Island? It's an island... made of garbage! It's in the Pacific Ocean. It's twice the size of Texas!
"," Robin: In other words, one-eighth the size of Canada. So...
"
" Ted: Me. I'm the bad guy.
"," Robin: Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero.
"
" Barney: You lying little minx. I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight from 5:00 p.m. until closing, reading a newspaper with two holes cut out of it, and I never saw Nora or this Italian race car driver she's dating.
"," Robin: Sorry. Who said anything about an...?
"
" Barney: Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver.
"," Robin: No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten.
"
" Barney: No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite!
"," Robin: You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship.
"
" Barney: No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great pen1s comes great responsibility.
"," Robin: Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one.
"
" Barney: Sorry?
"," Robin: I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve.
"
" Barney: Careful, Robin, I'll do it.
"," Robin: Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place.
"
" Barney: All right, Robin, give it to me.
"," Robin: Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, ""Yeah, Barney, go get her!"" But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.
"
" Barney: The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?
"," Robin: It's a five, idiot.
"
" Barney: A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?
"," Robin: ""Moon man language""? What does that even mean?

"
" Barney: It's true.
"," Robin: Totally. It is a tightrope, but still.
"
" Lily Robin.
"," Robin: Of course it was me.
"
" Lily: False. You think the Santa Claus, because it was Christmas.
"," Robin: Funny. Every year my mother took tea with her friend Easter Bell. Not so funny.
"
" Barney: And we have had. We had a group photo with Slash on my birthday. Great, huh? Eh?
"," Robin: It was there, we know the end.
"
" Barney: False!

"
" Lily: These girls have ruined so many things, or you forget Paris.
"," Robin: This is what happened in Paris?
"
" Lily: It will not surprise you, but the rest of the trip was horrible. I did a picture of a romantic kiss in front of the Eiffel Tower, I actually had. It was just between Karen and Francis, our server yesterday.
"," Robin: It's terrible. My laptop is just... fell. You me collected?(Barney looks to pick it up) Mouse, m*therf*cker! I!
"
" Barney: You sure?
"," Robin: Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing!
"
" Lily: The drawer under the oven. I can not wait. You're the best!
"," Robin: I'm sorry, Ted. I agree with Lily on this. This kind of evening is hard for someone new. That's why I have not brought Don. When I was in Japan, this guy, hot date for our third, took me to his brother's wedding. Now I, a complete stranger, am on the photo album of the marriage of a Japanese couple forever.
"
" Lily: Yes, okay, Ted. This bitch has proved some nice, but except for bitches, not the rule of bitches.
"," Robin: I'm starting to cry.
"
" Ted: And yet you're there, smiling as if nothing was wrong, completely wrong. Robin's birthday, there is 3 years old. Robin had a cold, and you made him remove his pajamas for the photo.
"," Robin: And you got me pinched cheeks very hard for them to be pink.
"
" Lily: Yeah, but you were beautiful.
"," Robin: And then we all ate chocolate cake in my bed.
"
" Ted: Thank you, Lil.

" Ted: You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship is to celebrate someone else's successful one.
"," Robin: Well, makes sense.
"
" Ted: So, with that mind, our friends Claudia and Stuart are having this crazy, black-tie wedding on Saturday. You wanna be my 'plus one'?

" Don: 12!...
"," Robin: You can... just look at your mug.

" (Mike gets up to leave, Robin follows)
"," Robin: Hey, I thought we were gonna follow those bread crumbs back to my place, Hansel
"
" Mike: Robin, I don't get the sense you like being with me.
"," Robin: I like being with you.
"
" Mike: Not as much as you like being alone. You like eating your own food, sleeping in your own bed, doing your own crosswords.
"," Robin: Well, who uses ink? Sorry. OK, I'm a bit set in my ways. That doesn't mean that this won't work.
"
" Mike: Actually, it kinda does.
"," Robin: Wait, are we breaking up?
"
" Lily: Sweetie, I'm so sorry.
"," Robin: Seriously it's not a big deal. He wanted to be a 'we,' and I wanted to be an 'I'. Dudes are such chicks. You guys, I'm fine.
"
" (Lily and Marshall kiss)
"," Robin: You guys, let me get a picture.
"
" (Ted sitting as people leave Halloween party, Robin walks in)
"," Robin: I had a feeling I'd find you here.
"
" Ted: Hey. If you're here for the Shagarats, you just missed the fourth encore.
"," Robin: I never played any team sports
"
" Ted: Are we playing 'I never' cuz there's nothing left but peach schnapps.
"," Robin: I played tennis in high school. You know why? Because it was just me out there. I couldn't even stand playing doubles. I just got dumped.
"
" Ted: Man, that sucks.
"," Robin: Yeah, it's OK. I wasn't that into him. Story of my life. Everyone else is all falling in love and acting stupid and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me. Why don't I want that more? I want to want that. Am I wired wrong or something?
"
" Ted: But you're wired just fine.
"," Robin: Well, what if I'm just a cold person? Tonight, Mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but I couldn't be Gretel. Why can't I be Gretel?
"
" Ted: Because you just haven't met the right Hansel yet. One day you're gonna meet a guy who's gonna make you want to look like a complete idiot.
"," Robin: Really?
"
" Ted: Yeah, he's out there somewhere, just like the Slutty Pumpkin. (echoes) pumpkin-pumpkin...
"," Robin: How do you do this, Ted? How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up.
"
" (Robin sits down by Ted and shares blanket)
"," Robin: Scoot.
"
" Ted: Sure you don't want one?
"," Robin: How many of those have you eaten?
"
" Ted: Why did I say that? I think frosting makes me lie.
"," Robin: Oh, Teddy boy.
"
" Ted: Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her. So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake.
"," Robin: All right, here's what you do: Put together a care package of stuff from New York-- some H&H bagels, an Empire State Building keychain... and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready? From three days ago.
"
" Ted: That's brilliant. You're brilliant. You know, it's funny, not so long ago, I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you.
"," Robin: That is funny.
"
" Ted from 2030: Little did I realize, a few weeks earlier, here's what Robin was saying to Lily about me.
"," Robin: Okay, fine, I have feelings for him.
"
" Ted: Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like.
"," Robin: The irony is clear, Ted.
"

"," Robin: So, did she get the awesome care package yet?
"
" Ted: Yep. Yesterday.
"," Robin: Did she love it?
"
" Ted: Ooh, she loved it.

"," Robin: Oh, Teddy boy.

" Ted: I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch. Maybe it just can't be do. I think it's clear what I have to do.
"," Robin: It's pretty clear.
"
" Ted: I have to go to Germany and surprise her.
"," Robin: Totally what I was thinking. Get out of my head, man!
"
" Ted: So she's going to dump me. Has anyone ever said, ""Listen, I've been thinking,"" and then follow it up with something good? It's not like: Listen, I've been thinking, Nutter-Butters are an underrated cookie. What else can it be? What could she possibly have to say to me that she couldn't write in an e-mail?
"," Robin: I cut off all my fingers? Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it. I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident. I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you.
"
" Ted: Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy. So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?
"," Robin: I'd wait.
"
" (Robin is on the phone with Ted)
"," Robin: Hello.
"
" Ted: Why hasn't she called yet?
"," Robin: Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.
"
" Ted: No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.
"," Robin: I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome.
"
" Ted: Hello.
"," Robin: Hi, Ted. It's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but, uh, do you want to come over?
"
" At Ted's apartment...
"," Robin: My career. This is my new priority. From now on, more a date. The job.
"
" Marshall: And you Robin? You leave it in play? Where is your book of Roles?
"," Robin: My book? Buddy... in two volumes, right here.
"
" Lily: Yeah, I'm reading it.
"," Robin: So, I have told you, I take a break on that side.
"
" Marshall: Bluntly.
"," Robin: What?
"
" Marshall: Very soon.
"," Robin: It's unlikely, I focus on my career, finished the rencards.
"
" Marshall: Kelly Harris, a fellow law school, said... ""The law school is too hard, I want to focus on courses. ""Six months later?Married!

"
" Ted: Travis Frenchroy, replacing bartender told me... ""I'm done with all these rencards. I want to concentrate on my fan fiction of Star Trek. ""Six months later... Married!
"," Robin: I answer? It's good for them...
"
" Lily: That must bother you a bit.
"," Robin: It's his life. These girls had it coming if they are stupid enough to be fooled.

"
" At the apartment, Ted and Marshall are at the console.
"," Robin: I'll fetch the newspaper.
"
" Marshall: Grave.
"," Robin: You must stop, seriously. The last thing I'm looking for now is a relationship.
"
" Marshall: It's like that. Have you any idea how many times in my life when I went to look for frozen waffles frozen in vain?
"," Robin: Thousands?
"
" Barney, entering: Everyone, code red! Emergency. Lock.Nobody gets out.
"," Robin: What happened?
"
" Barney: I tried the he will not come, and it worked. Monstrous.You should have seen this girl.
"," Robin: I'm leaving.

"," Robin: Sorry to interrupt but check it out.
"
" Barney: Forget it, kid. If anyone should be angry with me, this is Robin. She loves the book.
"," Robin: I did not worship the book.
"
" Barney: But what...? The Book of the Rolls, this is gold. Granted this is truly spectacular.
"," Robin: We just broke. The costumes are nice, but... it just broke.
"
" Barney: Hello, Claire. I am Lieutenant Frank Lyman. I train dolphins bomb detectors for... You know what? I can not do that.Robin, I'm sorry. I think this break is harder for me than expected.The Book of roles was just a way to change my mind.
"," Robin: It's okay. It's hard for me too. Look at me. I gave up on relationships.
"
" Marshall: I have to check my tuxedo.
"," Robin: I'll knock your heads like two coconuts.
"
" Lily:... is an incredible kind. He's funny and it's one of my best friends. And he came out with this gun.
"," Robin: It's a good guy.
"
" Marshall: It's a coffee, huh?
"," Robin: It's nothing.
"
" Lily: I had a message from Barney. ""Look under the table."" (She looks under the table and finds an envelope) A page from the Book of Roles.
"," Robin: It says what?
"
" A man with blonde hair and large between.
"," Robin: I will not fall in love with him.
"
" Between an old man in turn.
"," Robin: No comment. The blue jacket, it does not suit me, so...

"," Robin: I will work.
"
" Marshall: Yeah, right.
"," Robin: I'm really going to work.
"
" Man: You, Robin?
"," Robin: Yes.
"
" Ted (2030): This was the day she met Don.
"," Robin: Damn, Marshall.
"
" Ted: All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?
"," Robin: Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this.
"
" Barney: Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try... Here, have some water. Water! Here, drink this. Shh! Shh!
"," Robin: You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.
"
" Ted: Nope. I hit the snooze button.
"," Robin: And here come the paramedics.
"
" Marshall: I cannot believe that she gave him her number.
"," Robin: Maybe she really does have a brain injury.
"
" Ted: It's not like I have a list.
"," Robin: Oh, yes, you do.
"
" Ted from 2030: Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home.
"," Robin: Need a ride, cowboy?
"
" Ted: Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.
"," Robin: Hmm, too bad. I got candy.
"
" Ted: Candy?!
"," Robin: So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?
"
" Ted: Nope. Sworn to secrecy.
"," Robin: Oh, come on.
"
" Ted: I like your hat.
"," Robin: Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights.
"
" Ted: Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine.
"," Robin: Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took ""highlights"" to mean, ""I want to look like a tiger,"" hence the hat.
"
" Ted: Oh. I gotta see this.
"," Robin: No way.
"
" Ted: Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat!
"," Robin: So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?
"
" Ted: Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.
"," Robin: Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.
"
" Ted: Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.
"," Robin: I read that. More like ""Love in the Time of Don't Bothera.""
"
" Ted: You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.
"," Robin: We're not indoors. We're in a van.
"
" Ted: Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.
"," Robin: Never. What else?
"
" Ted: She loves lasagna.
"," Robin: Barf.
"
" Ted: You know, I am sensing a pattern here.
"," Robin: What else?
"
" Ted: Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.
"," Robin: And she's looking to get married and have kids?
"
" Ted: Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl.
"," Robin: Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids.
"
" Ted: Really? You don't want kids?
"," Robin: You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8:56. You're early.
"
" Ted: Hey, thanks for picking me up.
"," Robin: Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for.
"
" Ted: Thanks.
"," Robin: All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.
"
" Ted: You're going to show me your hair?
"," Robin: Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.
"
" Ted: You just made my night.
"," Robin: Go.
"
" Future Ted VO: Some aren't as nice.
"," Robin: And then there was Derek and counting you, that puts the total up to...
"
" Ted: You're scared of the Seven Dwarfs?
"," Robin: Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?
"
" Barney: Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either.
"," Robin: Why?
"
" Barney: Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?
"," Robin: No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.
"
" Barney: Come on, let's go.
"," Robin: All right, I'm in.
"
" Ted, Marshall: To the Willowbrook Mall!
"," Robin: Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going.
"
" Ted: What? Why not?
"," Robin: I just don't feel like going to a mall.
"
" Lily: We can split a cinnabun.
"," Robin: No, I'm really not gonna go.
"
" Ted: Come on, it'll be fun.
"," Robin: No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls.
"
" Barney: Why not?
"," Robin: I'd rather not say.
"
" Ted: Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls. If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to. I think we should all just respect her privacy.
"," Robin: Thanks Ted.
"
" Ted: So, what's the deal with you and malls?
"," Robin: You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to.
"
" Ted: Yeah, with those people. I'm your boyfriend. Come on, what is it? Did you get arrested in a mall?
"," Robin: No.
"
" Ted: Dumped in a mall?
"," Robin: Ted.
"
" Ted: Found out you were Canadian at a mall?
"," Robin: Let it go.
"
" Ted: Mauled at the mall?
"," Robin: Let it go. And who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Ted: Not me in Ohio when I was nine, that's for sure.
"
" Ted: I love you.
"," Robin: I used to be a dude.
"
" (flashback to Robin and Lily talking at bar)
"," Robin: A friend of mine in Canada got married way too young and it really turned her off to marriage.
"
" Lily: What do you think of this wedding cake?
"," Robin: Oh, I like it. Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada who got married too young? Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Field's giant cookie.
"
" (flashback to Barney, Lily, Marshall, Ted and Robin sitting around booth at MacLaren's)
"," Robin: My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.
"
" Ted: Husband.
"," Robin: There's no 'p' in husband.
"
" Ted: Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada.
"," Robin: Huh.
"
" Ted: I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that?
"," Robin: Are you asking me if I'm married? Ted: You can ask me. Nope, I'm not married. Your turn.
"
" Robin: Are you asking me if I'm married? Ted: You can ask me. Nope, I'm not married. Your turn.
"," Robin: What happened to respecting my privacy? Ted: Just say, ""no, I'm not married.""
"
" Robin: What happened to respecting my privacy? Ted: Just say, ""no, I'm not married.""
"," Robin: Ted, I don't understand why you can't...
"
" Ted: Just say, ""no, I'm not married.""
"," Robin: I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married.
"
" Ted: Why didn't you get divorced?
"," Robin: He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough.
"
" Ted: Good... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough.
"," Robin: I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this.
"
" Ted: Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest.
"," Robin: Thanks Ted.
"
" Ted: Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is.
"," Robin: I say we just move on.
"
" Ted: Sit down or buffet.
"," Robin: Um...
"
" Ted: Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember.
"," Robin: No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc.
"
" Ted: Hm. Band of DJ?
"," Robin: String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.
"
" Ted: Color scheme?
"," Robin: Dusty rose and sienna.
"
" Ted: Husband's name?
"," Robin: Um.
"
" Ted: You were never married.
"," Robin: Yes I was.
"
" Ted: No you weren't.
"," Robin: How do you know?
"
" Ted: I looked it up at the library.
"," Robin: What library?
"
" Ted: The one on 5th.
"," Robin: When did you go?
"
" Ted: Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad....
"," Robin: I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use?
"
" (Robin looks at Ted) Ted: Fine, Marshall looked it up in school.
"," Robin: You told Marshall?
"
" Ted: You lied to me!
"," Robin: See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret.
"
" Ted: But it was a fake secret.
"," Robin: Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too.
"
" Ted: Testing me, that's insane.
"," Robin: Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world?
"
" Ted: That wasn't a real secret.
"," Robin: Yeah, but it could have been.
"
" Ted: You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.
"," Robin: He moved there for business.
"
" Ted: I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.
"," Robin: I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.
"
" Barney: I know Robin's secret.
"," Robin: What?
"
" Barney: Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing.
"," Robin: Barney, don't, okay.
"
" (Ted closes laptop)
"," Robin: No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it.
"
" Marshall: I don't wanna get slapped again.
"," Robin: I wanna stress that I was young.
"
" Barney: Yeah you were.
"," Robin: And I didn't know any better.
"
" Barney: They never do.
"," Robin: And it started out as an innocent modeling job.
"
" (Barney slaps Marshall)
"," Robin: What the hell was that?
"
" Ted: I slap bet Marshall that you did p0rn, so I win.
"," Robin: p0rn? I wish it was p0rn, it would be less embarrassing.
"
" Robin Sparkles: Let's go the mall everybody! Come on, Jessica. Come on, Tori.
"," Robin: I was a teenage pop star in Canada.
"
" Marshall: That's you?
"," Robin: Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.
"
" Marshall: This is the 90's. Why does it look like 1986?
"," Robin: The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93.
"
" Ted: Go with the 10 now.
"," Robin: No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?
"
" Barney: I'm gonna go with the five for eternity.
"," Robin: Good call.
"
" Ted: Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone.
"," Robin: You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice.
"
" Lily: Whoo!!!
"," Robin: Lily! All we need is your indoor ""whoo.""
"
" Barney: Yeah, Lily, listen.
"," Robin: Barney's awesome.
"
" Lily: Wait, what are you saying?
"," Robin: We're just not feeling it right now. But we'll totally still be friends.
"
" Lily: Is it something I did?
"," Robin: Oh no, no, no. God, no. Lily, it's not you. It's us.
"
" Ted: God... you just get me.
"," Robin: OK, I should get going. I got a date.
"
" Barney: You're still seeing that guy?
"," Robin: Even better, seeing him naked.
"
" Barney: Girlfriend?
"," Robin: Slow your roll there, Lilypad.
"
" Lily: You've been together all summer. I don't get it.
"," Robin: Ok, It's like this. After we kissed, we sat down to have the talk.
"
" **FLASHBACK**
"," Robin: We should figure out what this is.
"
" And after having s*x:
"," Robin: Okay, now, we have to figure this out.
"
" **END OF FLASHBACK**
"," Robin: We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk.
"
" Lily: You needs it. Guys, you can't just keep hooking up and not at least try and figure out what you mean to each other.
"," Robin: Yeah, we knew you would say that. That's why we kept it a secret.

"
" Brad: Oh, man. Is this the talk?
"," Robin: What?
"
" Brad: No, this is good. Let's get it all out of the way. Robin, I'm looking for something serious.
"," Robin: No, Brad, no, it's...
"
" Brad: But before we go any further, you should know something about my stuff below the belt. I was born a little different.
"," Robin: God, no... Brad, no... This is about me and Barney.
"
" Brad: You and Barn... oh, so you guys are...
"," Robin: Well, we don't know what we are. I mean, my heart says ""leap into it."" My brain says ""it's a bad idea.""
"
" Brad: Okay, how about this. If you kiss me, and you feel bad about it, you're meant to be with Barney.
"," Robin: Why not? Lay it on me.
"
" Barney: Wow, wow, wow, Girlfriend? Hey, come on.
"," Robin: That's putting it a bit strongly.
"
" Barney: A bit strongly. She's not my girlfriend.
"," Robin: A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay?
"
" Barney: Hey, sorry I went little too far last night.
"," Robin: We've been over this. Unless I say ""flugelhorn"" you haven't gone too far.

"
" Marshall: Pancakes, fresh bacon. It is so yummy.

"
" Barney: I know, right?
"," Robin: Totally. But hum... Where do you see this relationship going?
"
" for a long time. I hope that doesn't make you mad.
"," Robin: Mad? I feel the same way. I suck at relationships. I mean, except with Ted. He really got it right. I know it's a cliché, but... he really ruined me for other men.

"," Robin: I know something we're good at.
"
" Barney: I don't know. If we're gonna do it again, I'm gonna need some Gatorade...
"," Robin: No,not that. Lying. Think about it. We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends. Why not just keep lying?
"
" Lily: Really?
"," Robin: Really. We sat down. We had the talk. Barney's my boyfriend now.
"
" Barney: And Robin's my girlfriend. I know it sounds nuts, but it feels good to say.

"
" Ted: ""Falling in? ""
"," Robin: Or Lily put it there for fun. That bitch is stuffed. I took it.It's just... so cute. Sock.
"
" Ted: Robin Scherbatsky, you get the idea of having children?
"," Robin: I know. One day, perhaps. When I'm 70. Science will catch me. I'm just... I'm lost right now. I'm unemployed, I live on a couch.
"
" Ted: There were two difficult months both. I have a room free.Why not come to me in the meantime?
"," Robin: Really?
"
" Ted: Yeah.
"," Robin: Thank you, Ted. I have some ideas, so it will be one week, two large max.
"
" Barney: No, Ted. It works for girls.
"," Robin: Look at these guys, individually. These geniuses are not childless by choice, my friend.
"
" Ted: Good night, Barney.
"," Robin: Good night.
"
" Lily: You guys will never believe what just happened to us.
"," Robin: I don't even believe it myself.
"
" Lily: I could see how you would think that but I have to have my own place. It's an independence thing.

"
" Lily: What the hell?
"," Robin: What?
"
" Lily: This is my apartment.
"," Robin: Where?
"
" Lily: What the hell?
"," Robin: Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant.
"
" Ted: What? What are you talking about?
"," Robin: And why is that girl checking you out?
"
" Barney: So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be?
"," Robin: Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right?
"
" Barney: Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment.
"," Robin: Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?
"
" Ted: All right.
"," Robin: You're going to the hospital?
"
" Ted: No, see, he's gonna go back over there and I'm gonna call him and he's gonna pretend that it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.
"," Robin: Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney.
"
" (Barney gets up to sit with Girl)
"," Robin: So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?
"
" Ted: He's gonna want the apartment. I'm gonna want the apartment. It's gonna lead to an argument, so no.
"," Robin: Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it.
"
" (Ted takes out his cell phone and starts dialing)
"," Robin: Ooh, can I do it?
"
" Barney: Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?
"," Robin: Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff.

"
" Barney: Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.
"," Robin: Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she!
"
" Ted: He was gonna take the swords down. Can you believe that?
"," Robin: Ted, why don't you just talk to him? He's your best friend.
"
" (Barney makes protest sounds)
"," Robin: One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.
"
" Barney: Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law.
"," Robin: A lemon law, like for cars.
"
" (Barney walks over to Robin at bar)
"," Robin: For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society.
"
" Barney: No, wrong, lemon law is awesome.
"," Robin: It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great.
"
" Barney: You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?
"," Robin: Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate.

"
" (Robin and Barney enter waiting area)
"," Robin: Is she OK?
"
" Barney: It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law.

"," Robin: So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon.
"
" Lily: Oh, help us.
"," Robin: What's wrong?
"
" Marshall: Every time we get near the food, we get cocktail weiner blocked. We haven't eaten all day.
"," Robin: All right, let's run some interference.
"
" Marshall: And you look like a pepper-crusted rack of lamb with mint jelly.
"," Robin: All right, let's get these two back to their table.

" Marshall: ""Love is patient and kind. ""Love does not envy or boast. ""It is not arrogant or rude. ""Love does not insist on it's own way. ""It is not irritable or resentful. ""Love bears all things, ""believes all things, ""hopes all things... ""endures all things.""

"," Robin: No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no.
"
" Ted: What are you talking about?

"
" Ted: That's not mine.
"," Robin: Then whose is it?
"
" Janna: Yes.
"," Robin: Wow. That was hilarious. I was like... what? Anyway.
"
" Ted: What the hell was that?
"," Robin: What the hell was what?
"
" Ted: That reaction?
"," Robin: I thought you were proposing to me.
"
" Ted: Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire.
"," Robin: Ted, you know how I feel about marriage.
"
" Ted: Now more than ever.
"," Robin: I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight?
"
" Ted: No.
"," Robin: Then why is this an issue?
"
" Ted: Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, ""No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. ""Ted, you cannot do this to me. ""No. No, no, no.""
"," Robin: Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go?

"," Robin: So did you guys find anything to eat?
"
" Flashback.
"," Robin: Ted, don't do this.
"
" Ted: No, seriously. Where do you see yourself in five years?
"," Robin: Where do you see yourself?
"
" Ted: Honestly, in five years... I probably want to be married.
"," Robin: And I probably want to be in Argentina.
"
" Ted: Argentina?
"," Robin: Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure.
"
" Flashback.
"," Robin: Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home?
"
" Ted: It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it.
"," Robin: Yeah? And how did that work out for you?
"
" Ted: I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license till we bring the horn back.
"," Robin: Well, come on, Ted, can you blame them?
"
" Ted: So... Argentina.
"," Robin: Argentina.
"
" Ted: Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina?
"," Robin: Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there.
"
" Ted: I could want to live in Argentina.
"," Robin: No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does.
"
" Ted: Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too. They have buildings in Argentina. And Paris. And even Tokyo. I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.
"," Robin: So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?
"
" Ted: Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina.
"," Robin: Oh, shut up.
"
" Ted: You're scared I might not be kidding.
"," Robin: Aren't you?
"
" Ted: Nope. Your move, Scherbatsky.
"," Robin: Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.
"
" Barney: No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina. The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years, the government is opposed to free market reforms, and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium. Man, she was chatty.
"," Robin: Right? Right?
"
" Flashback. Ted and Robin are in Robin's apartment kissing.
"," Robin: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
"
" Ted: What?
"," Robin: I don't know if I can do this to you.
"
" Ted: Do what?
"," Robin: Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids.
"
" Ted: Oh, right. 'Cause there are no kids there. On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black ""X"" over Argentina.
"," Robin: You know what I mean.
"
" Ted: No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect.
"," Robin: Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies.
"
" Flashback. Ted and Robin are kissing on the couch.
"," Robin: Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to start having babies right this second. Do you have a...?
"
" Ted. No, I don't.
"," Robin: Well, we probably shouldn't.
"
" Ted: Yeah.
"," Robin: Risk it?
"
" Barney: No. Robin, you're not... No, say the story's not over.
"," Robin: Come on, they're cutting the cake.
"
" Ted: Okay, time to get the horn back to the bistro.
"," Robin: Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again. That tuckered me out.
"
" Ted: Not a euphemism.
"," Robin: Right. Okay, let me just go change, and we'll leave.
"
" Ted: Whoa, whoa, you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh. Solidarity, sister.
"," Robin: That is crazy. I have a change of clothes and you don't. Suck it up.
"
" Ted: Well, if we'd actually moved in together, all my stuff would be here, but we didn't, so...
"," Robin: Yeah. We were all talk, weren't we?
"
" Ted: We're not doing this, are we?
"," Robin: I don't want to have kids in Argentina.
"
" Ted: And I don't want to have kids in Argentina.
"," Robin: So where does that leave us?
"
" Ted: Well... we could stay together and... pretend this stuff doesn't matter. Or... we could give back the blue French horn.
"," Robin: You stole a blue French horn for me.
"
" Barney: You're not pregnant?
"," Robin: Nope.

" Ted: Well, afterwards, uh, we came by to tell you guys, but Lily was pretty stressed out, so...
"," Robin: We decided not to say anything till after the wedding.
"
" Ted: Well, it hasn't been the easiest two weeks of our lives, but...
"," Robin: But we're okay.
"
" Kid: Excuse me, Miss.
"," Robin: Hi.
"
" Lily: Don't look at me. This morning Marshall said, ""I have to pee."" And I, ""Don't worry, baby, I'll do it for you."" Halfway through the pee, I'm, like, ""This doesn't even make sense!""
"," Robin: Well, uh, I've been to a couple funerals, so I know my role: I'm Vice Girl. Whatever Marshall needs to get through this day, I got it right here.
"
" Lily: Marshall's mom hasn't eaten, slept or sat down since we got here. Wait! That can be my role! I'll take care of Judy!
"," Robin: Yeah, but doesn't Marshall's mom hate you--the fact that you two aren't very close?
"
" Barney: She said ""doody.""
"," Robin: Really, guys? At a funeral?
"
" Barney: Wait a minute! Today, we are gonna make Marshall laugh.
"," Robin: How?
"
" Marshall: Hey, guys, sorry, uh... I left my charger back in New York, so my phone's out of juice. Does anyone have...?
"," Robin: Outlet or USB?
"
" Ted: You're like Mary Poppins, if her magic purse was also filled with drugs.
"," Robin: ""If""? Ted, the kids in that movie jumped into a painting and spent 15 minutes chasing a cartoon fox. ""Spoonful of sugar...""? Grow up.
"
" Marshall: My dad's last words to me were a string of odd racial stereotypes.
"," Robin: All that stuff was really nice!
"
" Man: I, uh, I hear you're a woman who can get things.
"," Robin: I've been known to locate certain objects from time to time.
"
" Man: I need vodka and dirty playing cards.
"," Robin: I got ya.
"
" Lily: You have a voice mail from your dad?
"," Robin: How?
"
" Marshall: I hold in my hand the last words my father will ever say to me. I'm gonna hit play.
"," Robin: What's wrong?
"
" Lily: Wait-- no, no, baby... Baby, I got it. Let me.
"," Robin: You should listen to it. Just don't put too much pressure on it.
"
" Barney: True story.
"," Robin: The point is, last words are overrated.
"
" Woman: Hey, so, um, I heard you might have...
"," Robin: You heard right. (whispering: ) I'm getting a reputation. So, what you need, mama? Come here.
"
" Lily: Yeah! Robin gave me a little orange pill from her purse. I don't know what's in it, but things are flowin' pretty smooth right now.
"," Robin: Hey, stay hydrated.
"
" Ted: That's awful.
"," Robin: No, here's the awful part.

" [FLASHBACK]
"," Robin: You remembered my birthday!
"
" Judy: Okay... okay, who is responsible for this? Who got Cousin Daphne drunk? She is 15 years old.
"," Robin: Whoa, they grow big out here.
"
" Barney: And here's your phone number back.
"," Robin: Judy, I...
"
" Ted: These stories suck.
"," Robin: Doesn't hold a candle to your Crocodile Dundee thing.
"
" Robin is calling her dad.
"," Robin: Hi, Dad.
"
" Marshall: Pff. That's not true. Uh, sometimes smaller is better. ""Hey, look how big my cell phone is!"" You don't hear people say that. No. You want something compact and efficient that fits comfortably in your pocket, and I think Max is just a great guy.
"," Robin: Lily told you.
"
" Barney: How can you speak of such things?
"," Robin: Girls talk about everything.
"
" Lily: Size, shape, left or right leaning orientation...
"," Robin: Length, resemblance to a historical figure, such as Winston Churchill... Yes, that's one of you. Girth, grooming...
"
" Barney: I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin... Wait a minute. Who's the girl?
"," Robin: Duh. Of course there's a girl.
"
" Marshall, thinking: Small pen1s. You have a small pen1s. Oh, that's super interesting, but you have a small pen1s. Damn it, Marshall! Okay. Okay. Think of any two words other than ""small"" or ""pen1s"". Got it: small pen1s. Damn it!
"," Robin: Yeah, I-I think it is so cool that you started your own law firm.
"
" Marshall: Yeah, but, uh, you know what they say. The important thing is-is how you use it, you know? ""The motion of the ocean."" That whole thing.
"," Robin: He said it's small, Marshall, and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on.
"
" Max: Nah. Everything about it is tiny. The office is tiny. The conference room is tiny. Plus, I got a very small staff.
"," Robin: Let's order!
"
" Max: Thanks, man. Next time, it is on me. Aw. Excuse me. I'll be right back. All right.
"," Robin: Totally.
"
" Lily: Damn, baby, be cool!
"," Robin: You're acting like he has six months to live.
"
" Marshall: It's your fault! You ladies and your salty sailor talk!
"," Robin: Oh, come on! What about you men and your locker room talk?
"
" Marshall: Yes, we do, but you know what we say? ""I hit that.""""I got some.""""I tapped it."" ""I squeezed those."" Discreet and efficient.
"," Robin: Not to mention classy.
"
" Marshall: Are you sure?
"," Robin: Yeah. That argument has no traction whatsoever.
"
" Lily: Ugh, he thinks I like this...But it feels disgusting.
"," Robin: Uh, it looks disgusting.
"
" Lily: ""Uh, is this working for you?""
"," Robin: Oh, of course, because what woman doesn't like being slobbered on while some giant paws at her nether regions like Lenny from Of Mice and Men?
"
" Lily: Oh, you're bad.
"," Robin: More Cosmos?
"
" Lily: Then he gets this panicked look on his face, says, ""I can't do this,"" and storms out.
"," Robin: Wow, that is weird.
"
" Lily: It was amazing. He was passionate, animalistic, a complete stud.
"," Robin: Wow. So he's right there making you say all this, huh?
"
" Lily: ""As the musky scent of man and Marshall's sure-footed traction intoxicated and overpowered me.""
"," Robin: That sounds real.
