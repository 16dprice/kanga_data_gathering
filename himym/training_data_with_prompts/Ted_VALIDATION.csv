" (Rachel laughs and heads back to her table, Ted turns to his beers and picks them up)
"," Ted: OK, guys, be cool.
"
" (Ted on phone at bar standing away from table Rachel and Trudy are sitting at)
"," Ted: I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident.
"
" (Ted on phone)
"," Ted: So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive.
"
" (Ted on phone)
"," Ted: And I don't know which one to go for.
"
" Lily: Are they friends? (Ted on phone)
"," Ted: Yeah. No, I don't know. They're old sorority sisters.
"
" (Ted on phone)
"," Ted: They're Kappas and I think I can score with one of them. I don't know which one and if I choose wrong, I lose 'em both.
"
" Trudy: Oh, Ted, OK, settle an argument. Is it stealing if you go out with someone's boyfriend after they've broken up?
"," Ted: Well, that's very complicated.
"
" Trudy: You're the man-thief, man-thief.
"," Ted: Oh, somebody should lock you girls up.
"
" (Ted's phone rings)
"," Ted: (muttering to himself) I am never not wearing a suit again.
"
" (Ted answers phone)
"," Ted: Hello.
"
" Lily: It's me, I'm at the bar. Don't look, just call me mom.
"," Ted: Hi Mom, how's dad's colon?
"
" Lily: What? What's the matter with you? Anyway, both of these girls are into you. Take your pick.
"," Ted: They are? Are you sure?
"
" Lily: Yes, of course. They're playing with their hair and touching your arm. Class green light.
"," Ted: Are you positive?
"
" Lily: Oh, it's Robin. Good luck.
"," Ted: Bye mom.
"
" (Ted hangs up phone)
"," Ted: My mom.
"
" (Lily hangs up and rushes out of bar)
"," Ted: So, this college boyfriend, who, who won him?
"
" Rachel: We were gonna do, but never did.
"," Ted: What? What, what were you guys gonna do but never did.
"
" Trudy: I don't care.
"," Ted: Nobody cares, just say it.
"
" (Ted on cell phone)
"," Ted: It's a tricycle.
"
" (Barney passes phone to Marshall)
"," Ted: It's a tricycle.
"
" Marshall: Wait wait wait, what belt?
"," Ted: Barney and I have this running joke that the first guy to actually pull this off would win the championship belt.
"
" (flashback to Barney removing a large belt from a box) Barney: Behold.
"," Ted: You actually bought a belt.
"
" Barney: That's right, it's resplendent.
"," Ted: It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around.
"
" Lily: If I died, I'd just come back and haunt your pen1s.
"," Ted: Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?
"
" Barney: All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?
"," Ted: Yes.
"
" Barney: Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds.
"," Ted: Yes.
"
" Barney: Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women?
"," Ted: What? No.
"
" Barney: Ted?
"," Ted: No. Look, I gotta go. They're gonna think I inherited my dad's imaginary bathroom issues.
"
" (Ted walks in from restroom, Trudy and Rachel are walking towards front door)
"," Ted: Oh, are you guys leaving?
"
" Rachel: Well, it is getting pretty late.
"," Ted: Right, well...
"
" Trudy: I thought maybe we could all go and listen to that Wilco CD you talked about before.
"," Ted: Great, I have it right upstairs. It's in my apartment upstairs. Let's so upstairs.
"
" Rachel: I'm sorry, where was your apartment again?
"," Ted: That's funny. I love that. You should tell more jokes at my apartment upstairs.
"
" (Ted picks up his keys)
"," Ted: Got 'em.
"
" Rachel: Hey, are these your roommates?
"," Ted: Yes, yes, but they are not here. They are somewhere else. We have total privacy because privacy is essential when you're listening to music.
"
" Rachel: You know what else is essential when you're listening to music? Music.
"," Ted: That's hilarious. You are hilarious. I'll go get it in my bedroom. The CD's in my bedroom. Bedroom.
"
" (Rachel and Trudy laugh, they sit on the couch)
"," Ted: This is gonna be awesome.
"
" (Ted walks into his bedroom with Rachel and Trudy's coats, Ted sees Lily, Marshall and Barney in his room)
"," Ted: No!
"
" (back from commercial break)
"," Ted: What are you guys doing here? I've got, I've got...
"
" (Lily puts Marshall's hand down)
"," Ted: You guys need to get out of here right now. Please, take the fire escape.
"
" Lily: Oh, you can use our bedroom.
"," Ted: OK, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD...Barney.
"
" (Barney picks up CD from Ted's bedside table and snaps it in half)
"," Ted: What are you doing?
"
" Barney: I cannot allow Ted to do this.
"," Ted: Why, why?
"
" (back to present scene)
"," Ted: Let me get this straight. You're gonna trike block me? That is so petty. It's like you're...
"
" Marshall: Tom Petty.
"," Ted: Tom Petty. You're Tom Petty.
"
" (Ted turns around and sees his door open and Lily not in his room anymore)
"," Ted: Where's Lily?
"
" (Ted walks out of his room to find Lily standing, looking at girls on couch, Ted pushes her into his room)
"," Ted: Still looking for that CD, so...
"
" (Ted goes back into his room)
"," Ted: What are you doing?
"
" Lily: I cannot give up my bedroom to a boot thief. She should be punished, not rewarded.
"," Ted: Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me.
"
" (Lily turns away from Ted and crosses her arms)
"," Ted: What if I reimburse you for the boots, full retail?
"
" (Ted gets money out and gives it to Lily)
"," Ted: OK, take it.
"
" (Lily takes money)
"," Ted: Wish me luck.
"
" (Ted walks back into the living room)
"," Ted: So, I'm having a little trouble finding the CD.
"
" (Rachel seats Ted down between herself and Trudy)
"," Ted: Exactly.
"
" (Ted smiles at Trudy, image of belt shows up over his forehead while Ted starts to look nervous and sweaty)
"," Ted: It's getting late, I'll get your coats.
"
" Barney: Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me.
"," Ted: See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?
"
" Barney: The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn.
"," Ted: It won't?
"
" (fantasy scenario, Ted walks into living room in dressing gown)
"," Ted: Ladies, couldn't find your coats but I did find tequila.
"
" (Fantasy Scenario Ted talks to camera)
"," Ted: Wait, wait wait, a remote control fire place? We don't have a remote control fire place.
"
" (Fantasy Scenario Ted talks to camera)
"," Ted: Why would I want to tire them out?
"
" Rachel: You give the most amazing foot massage.
"," Ted: It's 'cause I used to practice all the time on my grandmother.
"
" (Fantasy Scenario Ted talks to camera)
"," Ted: Why in God's name would I say that?
"
" Trudy: Ted, what's wrong?
"," Ted: I was just thinking about this documentary I saw once about something called a supervolcano.
"
" (Fantasy Scenario Ted talks to camera)
"," Ted: OK, what the hell.
"
" (Fantasy scenario continues)
"," Ted: Could happen at any time and obliterate all life on earth, which is why I live by three simple words. Don't postpone joy.
"
" Trucy: That's so true.
"," Ted: Yeah.
"
" (back to present scene in Ted's room)
"," Ted: Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this.
"
" (Barney, Ted, Marshall and Lily group-hug)
"," Ted: All right.
"
" (Ted walks over to his door, grabs doorknob, stops and turns back)
"," Ted: I'll see you on the other side.
"
" Barney: You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me!
"," Ted: Some stories you tell, some stories you don't.
"
" Ted from 2030: Previously on How I Met Your Mother...
"," Ted: She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and...
"
" Victoria: I've just been offered a fellowhip at a culinary institute in Germany.
"," Ted: Do you want to try long distance?
"
" Robin: ""This long-distance thing sucks, huh? And I really need to talk to you tonight.""
"," Ted: She's going to dump me!
"
" Robin: She's not going to break up with you, Ted.
"," Ted: Hello?
"
" Ted from 2030: Kids, your grandma always used to say to me, ""Nothing good happens after 2:00 a.m.,"" and she was right. When 2:00 a.m. rolls around, just go home and go to sleep. Case in point:
"," Ted: Hello.
"
" Robin: Hello.
"," Ted: Why hasn't she called yet?
"
" Robin: Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.
"," Ted: What's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.
"
" Robin: Hey, guys. Miss me? I missed you, too. Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over? Ted?
"," Ted: Uh, yeah... Uh, hi, I'm here.
"
" Robin: Do you want to come over?
"," Ted: Why? What's up?
"
" Robin: Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like, ""You know who likes juice? Ted.""
"," Ted: I love juice.
"
" Ted from 2030: When it's after 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep because the decisions you make after 2:00 a.m. are the wrong decisions.
"," Ted: Okay, sure. I'll come over. We'll... juice.
"
" Robin: Yes, we'll juice.
"," Ted: Okay.
"
" Robin: Okay... bye.
"," Ted: Bye.
"
" In a cab
"," Ted: This is fine. This is totally fine.
"
" Cab driver: What's fine?
"," Ted: Oh, I'm, uh, going over to this girl's house to make some juice.
"
" Cab driver: Nice.
"," Ted: No, it's not like that. We're juicing as friends. See, I have this girlfriend, I would never cheat on her. She lives in Germany. See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk. I still haven't heard from her. I don't know. Sorry to bug you with my problems. Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh?
"
" Cab driver: You ain't kidding, kid. Want a nip?
"," Ted: You can just let me out right up here.
"
" Cab driver: Where you going to, buddy?
"," Ted: Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth. Okay, here's where I left off with the last guy. See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over to this other girl's house...
"
" Victoria: And you're wondering if I'd be upset. Hi, Ted. Remember me, your girlfriend?
"," Ted: Okay, relax, Robin's just a friend.
"
" Victoria: Right. You're going to go make some juice.
"," Ted: Yes, yes! Juice is perfectly harmless. In fact, it's healthy.
"
" Victoria: Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering what she looks like naked?
"," Ted: I am not won... Okay, even if I am wondering that, it's only 'cause you put it in my head.
"
" Victoria: Ah, but I'm just a manifestation of your subconscious, so actually, you put it in your own head.
"," Ted: Damn it! Nothing's going to happen.
"
" Victoria: Right.
"," Ted: Okay, okay. You want a second opinion? Fine.
"
" Marshall: Hey, did she call?
"," Ted: No. I need a ruling. Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but I'm on my way over to Robin's right now. She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out.
"
" In the cab
"," Ted: Come on, pick up. Damn it, Victoria, where are you? Pick up, pick up!
"
" Victoria: Cupcake?
"," Ted: No, thanks. Where are you? Why haven't you called?
"
" Victoria: Oh, I'm out hooking up... with three other guys. Or maybe I'm a devoted girlfriend and I'm calling you right now.
"," Ted: Yeah. Why do I doubt that? Hello.
"
" Marshall: Ted, I just saw the news and a truck carrying sulphuric acid overturned right in front of Robin's house. And it's melting through the sidewalk. You can see straight down into hell. It's bad. You should go home, dude.
"," Ted: Marshall, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen.
"
" Marshall: Ted, what does your mom always say?
"," Ted: Nothing good ever...
"
" Marshall: Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m. Go home! It's too late for juice.
"," Ted: Dude, Robin and I are just friends. She doesn't even like me that way.
"
" Lily: Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.
"," Ted: What?
"
" Lily: It's a big secret, so don't tell her I told you, but she's very vulnerable right now and you have a girlfriend. Go home, Ted.
"," Ted: She-she likes me?
"
" Lily: Yes. So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there. Go home, Ted.
"," Ted: She likes me?
"
" Lily: Go home, Ted.
"," Ted: Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home.
"
" Ted from 2030: I did have more sense than that.
"," Ted: Keep the change.
"
" Victoria: So you're doing this? You're going up there?
"," Ted: You want to get out of the way?
"
" Victoria: I'm not in the way.
"," Ted: You know, if you had just called me, I...
"
" Robin: Hi.
"," Ted: Hi. Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets.
"
" Robin: Or we could just drink wine.
"," Ted: Wine... not? Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
"
" Robin: Thanks.
"," Ted: Make it a big glass.
"
" Robin: Sure.
"," Ted: So, how's it hanging?
"
" Robin: Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore or what the hell you're doing with your life? Do you ever have one of those days?
"," Ted: Uh, about once a week.
"
" Ted from 2030: When the clock strikes 2:00, just go to sleep.
"," Ted: We broke up.
"
" Robin: What?
"," Ted: Yeah. Yeah, she finally called. We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is-- and then... she dumped me.
"
" Robin: Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful.
"," Ted: You're smiling.
"
" Robin: Am I? No I'm not. I'm a news anchor. Smiling's a part of the job. Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today. See? You're smiling, too.
"," Ted: Yeah. I have no idea what that's all about.
"
" At Robin's
"," Ted: So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look.
"
" Robin: Oh, yeah. Do you like it?
"," Ted: Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right.
"
" Robin: Wow. Weird.
"," Ted: Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this.
"
" (Ted goes out in the hall)
"," Ted: Hello?
"
" Marshall: Sorry about that.
"," Ted: Was that Korean Elvis?
"
" Marshall: I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's.
"," Ted: Um... Actually... I'm at Robin's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.
"
" Marshall: Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis, but what the bleep are you doing, dude?
"," Ted: What do you expect from me? It's Robin. Victoria's great, but, it's Robin. I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria.
"
" Lily: Gonna?
"," Ted: Yes. First thing tomorrow.
"
" Lily: Okay, but, but, as of right now at-at... 2:45 a.m. you still have a girlfriend. Ted, I love you. I love Robin. But if you do this right now, your entire future with her will be built on a crime. Just go home, Ted. Don't do this the wrong way.
"," Ted: I hate how you're always right.
"
" Lily: It's my best and most annoying trait.
"," Ted: Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.
"
" Robin: Hey.
"," Ted: I should probably get going. It's pretty late. I'm sorry. I...
"
" Robin: Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.
"," Ted: Can I call you tomorrow?
"
" Robin: Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.
"," Ted: Okay. Good night, Robin.
"
" Robin: Oh, my God. We're making out.
"," Ted: Right.
"
" Robin: This is crazy.
"," Ted: Right? Right?
"
" Robin: Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...
"," Ted: Yeah.
"
" Robin: Yeah?
"," Ted: Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.
"
" (Ted goes to the bathroom while Robin waits in the living room)
"," Ted: Stop doing that.
"
" Victoria: Whatcha doin'?
"," Ted: I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.
"
" Victoria: Okay. Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be? Length of an average pee? No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes. Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive...
"," Ted: What do you want from me? People break up. It happens.
"
" Victoria: Not like this. Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with.
"," Ted: It's not ideal.
"
" At Robin's
"," Ted: You're right. I owe you a real breakup call. I'll call you tomorrow.
"
" Victoria: Good. So you're gonna go home?
"," Ted: Why should I have to go home? You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry.
"
" Victoria: Ted.
"," Ted: It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Robin. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay.
"
" Victoria: Oh, please. You just want to get laid.
"," Ted: Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night.
"
" Victoria: That's not your phone.
"," Ted: This isn't my phone.
"
" Robin: Okay. Bye. (She hungs up) I thought it was mine, so I answered it.
"," Ted: Was it...?
"
" Marshall: Okay! I made a list of awesome baby names. Starting at the top: number one...
"," Ted: I'm gonna stop you right here, Marshall. You name a chubby white kid ""LeBron,"" and he's the one getting stuffed in the basketball hoop.
"
" Marshall: um, how about ""Ryan""?
"," Ted: Ooh.
"
" Marshall: Our DVR won't recognize it as a television program.
"," Ted: I watched. Robin insisted I confirm how ""awful"" Becky is, so last night I checked it out.
"
" Robin: Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky?
"," Ted: Mmm... (muttering) I thought she was charming.
"
" Marshall: No, she is not my daughter. I'm just her daddy.
"," Ted: Wow. That is disgusting.
"
" (Marshall and Ted go away)
"," Ted: Marshall, your list is entirely boy names. You do realize there's roughly a 50% chance of you having a daughter, right?
"
" Marshall: I don't want a girl. I just want a little boy.
"," Ted: It's not what it sounds like, folks.
"
" The Bar
"," Ted: Ow!
"
" Robin: Ted, of all the women in New York, you had to go out with an eight-year-old girl?
"," Ted: Not what it sounds like, folks.
"
" Robin: Ted, you know that I hate her. How could you go out on a date with this girl?
"," Ted: It wasn't a date. She came over to the apartment looking for you.
"
" Becky: I made Robin my famous chocolate chip cookies. But instead of chocolate chips, I used gummie bears.
"," Ted: Aww...
"
" Robin: Let me guess: she acted like a helpless little girl, and you stepped in as the big, strong man.
"," Ted: I don't know if that's totally true.
"
" [FLASHBACK]
"," Ted: It's okay, little darlin'.
"
" Becky: Poor spider.
"," Ted: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Spiders gotta die so trees can grow.
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Ted: Then I held her tight and told her it was all gonna be okay. By the way, I think I only wounded the spider. It crawled off into my bedroom.
"
" Robin: Wait. Is that why you slept on the couch last night?
"," Ted: (scoffing) Yeah, I slept.
"
" Robin: Yeah, we don't care about this...
"," Ted: No one challenged you, so it wasn't really a challenge.
"
" Barney: Challenge accept...
"," Ted: Wow, I'm glad that's over. It was creepy watching Barney talk like a little kid.
"
" Robin: Oh, but you find it irresistible when Becky does? I don't get it. The Ted that I went out with was attracted to the kind of woman who could use a steak knife without supervision.
"," Ted: For your information, Becky doesn't like steak, she likes pasghetti. Spaghetti. And more importantly, she makes me feel needed.
"
" Robin: Needed? (scoffs) She makes training wheels feel needed.
"," Ted: Hey, it's nice to feel needed. And you know what? It's not a feeling guys get when they're with you.
"
" Robin: When we were dating, I... I didn't make you feel needed?
"," Ted: Come on! You always took charge of everything.
"
" Robin: I got this.
"," Ted: Thanks.
"
" (Later, on the couch)
"," Ted: This okay? Am I hurting y...
"
" (Later)
"," Ted: Someone's trying to break in-- call the cops.
"
" Robin: Did that really bother you?
"," Ted: Well, yeah. It's nice to be needed. Look, I'm sorry. (phone chimes) I didn't mean to upset you. It's Becky. Aw, she's trapped in a revolving door.
"
" Robin: I got this.
"," Ted: Yeah.
"
" Ted is offering an ice cream to Becky
"," Ted: Shoe's untied. I got it. Yeah, this is over.
"
" Future Ted VO: Kids, back in the fall of 2007, I was dating this girl named...oh God, what was her name? It's been 23 years, I can't remember all this stuff. For the sake of the story, let's call her...
"," Ted: Everyone, this is Blah-blah.
"
" Blah-blah: Well, I was taking this cooking class, French fusion, and everyone already had a partner but then I looked up, and across a crowded room, I saw Ted. It was magical.
"," Ted: It was so magical.
"
" (flashback to 'one hour earlier,' Barney, Robin, Ted, Marshall and Lily enter MacLaren's)
"," Ted: She's gonna tell some bogus story about a cooking class because she's embarrassed we met online.
"
" (Everyone sits down at booth)
"," Ted: What? There's no stigma anymore.
"
" Barney: So, she's hot.
"," Ted: Oh, she's gorgeous.
"
" Barney: Then she's crazy.
"," Ted: No she's not.
"
" Barney: Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes.
"," Ted: OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me.
"
" Barney: There's no way she's above the line on the hot-crazy scale.
"," Ted: She's not even on the hot-crazy scale. She's just hot.
"
" INT. MACLAREN'S
"," Ted: OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class.
"
" Barney: I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts...
"," Ted: She's not crazy.
"
" Barney: It's crazy how cute that is. It's crazy.
"," Ted: You know who else has a really cute story of how they met? Marshall and Lily. You guys should tell that story right now.
"
" (Blah-blah gets up and walks over to bar, Barney looks at Ted)
"," Ted: Anybody'd be stressed out meeting new people. She's not crazy. Crazy generous maybe, buying us drinks.
"
" Blah-blah: Hm. Oh, so, pretty and single and friends with Ted. Great.
"," Ted: You know who else is friends with Ted? Marshall. How did we meet? It's a good story, I'm gonna tell it right now. Uh, it was the first day of college.
"
" Blah-blah: Oh good, 'cause I'm not. Now, Robin, could you just let it go? You're making all of us really uncomfortable.
"," Ted: You know what else is a good story, how Barney and I met. Barney, tell that story, right now. Please.
"
" Barney: Tonight's the first time I'm taking my deaf brother out since our mom died.
"," Ted: Oh, I'm sorry about that.
"
" Barney: No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh.
"," Ted: Oh man, I'm really sorry.
"
" (Barney flushes and walks toward sink)
"," Ted: What? Barney: I just made that up mid-pee. It worked on you, it's definitely gonna work on that blonde chick at the end of the bar. Unless you're a total idiot. What's your name?
"
" Ted: What? Barney: I just made that up mid-pee. It worked on you, it's definitely gonna work on that blonde chick at the end of the bar. Unless you're a total idiot. What's your name?
"," Ted: Ted.
"
" Barney: Are you a total idiot, Ted?
"," Ted: Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Barney: (laughs) Well played.
"
" Barney: Barney. We met at the urinal.
"," Ted: Oh right, hi.
"
" Barney: Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit.
"," Ted: I'm not wearing a suit.
"
" Barney: He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like.
"," Ted: (signing) I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.
"
" Barney: What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.
"," Ted: (signing) My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number.

"
" Marshall: I'm sorry, who are you again?
"," Ted: This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass.
"
" Barney: I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed.
"," Ted: You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.

"
" Marshall: Unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl? Yeah.
"," Ted: I'm too-much-tongue guy.
"
" Marshall: I don't think you need to be. I was at that party. It was dark, and granted, I had eaten quite a few sandwiches but I'm a hundred percent sure that unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl was Alexa Leskies, it's not Lily.
"," Ted: Really? Marshall: Yeah, I'm positive. And too-much-tongue guy was Colin O'Riley.

"," Ted: Of course. Look at this.

"," Ted: Yes, I avoid it. What is the problem? It goes like this.
"
" Marshall: It's that ""one"" small dicks?
"," Ted: No, 'on', it is the people of the great state of Ohio. When life is hard, we take the pain and bury us. And if the pain goes, is buried pain over another. Why cope when you can avoid?All I have to do is to never see her again, and I will have a long happy life. So who wants to eat?

"," Ted: Really?
"
" Robin: He wanted a son and the fact that I am a girl has not changed.
"," Ted: How so?
"
" Robin: That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what? ""I wish not to be raised as a boy, that thou teach me not to hunt, fish and smoke cigars and drinking scotch because girls do not do that. And you know why I run like a girl? Because I am one. ""

"
" Robin: Yes.
"," Ted: It has returned to you.
"
" Ted (2030): And I realized... all my friends were haunted, but there was a difference between my and their ghosts. It was not too late for me.

" Robin: This is so exciting.
"," Ted: Bluntly.
"
" Lily: You're gonna say what?
"," Ted: I will say, ""Sorry it did not work. ""We will discuss in adults. She'll tell me his views and... I will listen. What I should have done more before.

" Marshall: You have to get angry. Go ahead. Looking good.
"," Ted: Come on. There is no question of moving his arms, stomping feet and get angry. This is Stella and I finally communicating. Clearly, it was...

"," Ted: That's his problem.

"
" Lily:... and that you face all that, but... you only have one chance. Take a moment and think about what you will say.
"," Ted: I know exactly what I say. (Ted comes out of the taxi) You chose the wrong guy. You chose the wrong guy. You did a very, very, very bad choice. What were you thinking? This guy? You kidding me? Have you learned anything these past 8 years? You'll be sorry. You know it? You'll be sorry, and you can do anything about it because it is too late. Anything you can do is start up your life miserable and disappointing that will never be as happy as it could be with me. Goodbye.
"
" Stella: Ted, wait.
"," Ted: Look, I'm not there to pick you. I am here because I need to know that you know you've made the worst mistake of your life.
"
" Stella: I know.
"," Ted: Okay. (Ted is still in the taxi) This is what I say.
"
" Robin: Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more.

"
" Marshall: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

"
" Barney: You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.
"," Ted: The good Backstreet Boys?
"
" Marshall: Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?!
"," Ted: What-what the hell happened to you?
"
" Barney: Ah, let me see what I can do.
"," Ted: What? What can you do?
"
" Marshall: Lily is gonna kill me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this.
"," Ted: That's crazy. Of course she will.
"
" Marshall: Would you marry me?
"," Ted: No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule: never marry anyone you've had a farting contest with.
"
" In Marshall's room...
"," Ted: Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution.
"
" Marshall: Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?!
"," Ted: What?!
"
" Marshall: You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo.
"," Ted: Dude, those guys are criminals.
"
" Marshall: Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something!
"," Ted: Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these.
"
" Ted's in the wedding room...
"," Ted: Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?
"
" Ben: Yes.
"," Ted: Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out.
"
" Ben: Yeah.
"," Ted: Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head.
"
" Ben: Oh, no!
"," Ted: Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area?
"
" Ben: Yeah, that would probably work, but with what? That's a tough one.
"," Ted: Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches
"
" Ben: Mm, yeah. Does anyone here wear a toupee? (Ben's wearing a toupee) Shouldn't be hard to find out. Most of them are pretty bad.
"," Ted: That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair.
"
" Ben: Boy, that's a pretty tall order.
"," Ted: Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?
"
" Ben: No, not off the top of my... No. Can't.
"," Ted: Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee.
"
" Marshall: Actually, I think it kinda works.
"," Ted: It totally does.
"
" Marshall: Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it?
"," Ted: It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.
"
" Marshall: Oh, you know...
"," Ted: In a bad way.
"
" Brad: Hey. Cool hair, bro.
"," Ted: What happened to your shirt?
"
" Brad: I got sauce on it when I tackled the caterer.
"," Ted: You gonna put another shirt on?
"
" Barney: It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.
"," Ted: Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress.
"
" Marshall: I wish we could have that wedding.
"," Ted: So do it.
"
" Marshall: What?
"," Ted: Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate.
"
" Lily: I don't have mine either.
"," Ted: You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other.
"
" Marshall: Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick. You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called ""Eggs Marshall,"" and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy.
"," Ted: No problem.
"
" In the bathroom...
"," Ted: Please don't.
"
" Ted from 2030: Kids, sometimes wonderful things come out of horrible situations. Like, remember that trip I took to Hong Kong where I got stuck in the airport? Well, a funny thing happened that day.
"," Ted: Yes, I realize it's raining, but, come on, it's 2021. We can make cell phones that project holograms, but a light drizzle shuts down a whole airport?

" Woman: Actually, I said, ""How's your meat?""
"," Ted: Oh. A little cold.
"
" Zoey: Oh, Ted, did you have a chance to pick up that box I left at my old apartment?
"," Ted: Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain. I mean this in a super manly way. That guy scares the panties off me.
"
" Zoey: You don't have to see him. He left the box with the doorman.
"," Ted: If it's really important to you, I will pick it up tomorrow.
"
" Marshall: All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big meaningless stack of paperwork that I have to get off my desk to make room for tomorrow's big meaningless stack of paperwork. But it's all worth it, you know, 'cause at least I know I'm making the world a... place. All right, see you guys later.
"," Ted: I'm worried about Marshall. He doesn't seem like himself lately.

" Barney: I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds.
"," Ted: Anyway, we should get going.

"," Ted: I'm here to...
"
" Captain: Ted. What a surprise. Ted.
"," Ted: Captain. I...
"
" Captain:You've come to rescue me from the capsized wreckage of my marriage. Mm... I hesitated calling you because I know you and Zoey were friendly.
"," Ted: Pssh, nah...
"
" Barney: Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is ""$12 million,"" and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance.
"," Ted: Guys, I got a problem. I ran into The Captain.
"
" Captain:Ted, beneath this lustrous mane,I wear the horns of a cuckold. Zoey left me for another man.
"," Ted: Wow.
"
" Captain: Once upon a time, Zoey and I were happy. Blissful as Arcadian shepherds. I was Poseidon, she my Amphitrite. I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis could not have torn us asunder. We had great big boners for each other. But then... enter the scoundrel. I don't know what he looks like, but I picture him with a mustache.
"," Ted: Yes! Limit the search to guys with mustaches. Smart.
"
" Captain: Anyway, soon the inevitable happened. She told me she was in love with someone else. Obviously, it made me angry.
"," Ted: And that's the last time you saw her.
"
" Captain: But I gathered my composure, and told her I'd do anything to keep her. I begged her not to leave. We made love that night.

" Captain: Hello, Ted.
"," Ted: To the study?
"
" Captain: To the study! Mmm. Ted... I know.
"," Ted: Know what?
"
" Captain: I know who stole my Zoey. No man likes to be betrayed, especially by a friend. You can imagine then how painful it was when I learned that the name of my betrayer is... Ted... when I tell you who it is, you're gonna... It's my doorman!
"," Ted: That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?
"
" Captain: He always winks and tips his hat when he sees her. I know how these things work. He holds her package, and pretty soon, she's holding his. And then there's his glorious mustache. I will have him fired for this!
"," Ted: No, no, no, you can't fire him.
"
" Captain: You're right. Maritime protocol demands physical retribution!
"," Ted: Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop!
"
" Captain: Who is this flower child, and what has he done with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?!
"," Ted: Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!
"
" Captain: Whoa, ""rapscallion"" may be going a bit far, Ted.
"," Ted: But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that.
"
" Captain: Why couldn't she just like boats? Just to have one thing in common? Other girls like boats, don't they?
"," Ted: Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey.
"
" Captain: When you put it that way, I should almost thank the doorman.

"," Ted: So I'm the bad guy. Great.
"
" Zoey: Well, the story isn't over, Ted. It'll be years before we know who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. I mean, yes, divorce sucks, but sometimes things need to fall apart to make way for better things.

"," Ted: I did.

"
" Stuart: The point is, I wanna get married, I wanna settle down. But right now, that's just not who I am. I'm not a commitment guy, I'm a single guy.
"," Ted: Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other. Everybody feels this way sometimes.
"
" Stuart: How would you know, you're not even married?
"," Ted: OK, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily. He's the pro. This guy knows relationships. Tell him, Marshall.
"
" Marshall: Stuart, don't get married.
"," Ted: Dude.
"
" Marshall: I'm sorry. Being in a couple is hard and committing, making sacrifices, it's hard. But if it's the right person, then it's easy. Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life, that should be the easiest thing in the world. And if it's not like that, then she's not the one. I'm sorry.

" (Stuart and Claudia walk away)

"," Ted: See! That right there is what free will gets you. Constant ego-shattering uncertainty. I'm done with that. I want what Ranjit has. I've spent my entire adult life looking for the perfect woman and I'm spending Valentine's Day scrubbing the toilet. I need someone else to find me that woman. Marshall, Lily, arrange-marriage me!
"
" Marshall: You want us to arrange your marriage?

"," Ted: Get out there and find me a girl. We'll double date on Valentine's Day. If I like her, I will marry her... if she's cool with it. And she will be. Cause I'll wear my nice blazer.
"
" Marshall: Robin, neurologically speaking, the part of the human brain that makes you hate people is located right next to the part of the brain that makes you want to jump people's bones. The two responses are so similar, it's hard to tell them apart.
"," Ted: You know what it's like? Wait, I have to get a book. Give me 30 seconds.
"
" (22 minutes later)
"," Ted: OK this is fun. Look at this picture. It's a rabbit! You can look at it for hours and be absolutely sure it's a rabbit. But then one day, you look at it and you realize, ""wait a second, it's a duck!"" Rabbit, duck, rabbit, duck. Isn't it fun?
"
" Marshall: Relationships are like that. I mean, look, when you first met Don, you hated him, you thought ""This guy's a duck"", but one of these days you're gonna realize ""This is actually someone that I love, he's a rabbit"".

" Marshall: Judged. By nature.
"," Ted: Trust me. I would not get interested in relationships. I would not be single if I wanted to be single.
"
" Lily: Okay. Are you ready?
"," Ted: Ready for what?
"
" Lily: Three years ago, Shelly started working at my school.When I saw her, I said, ""It's perfect for Ted.""
"," Ted: Why do not you talk to me now?
"
" Ted, with chicken fingers in the mouth: This girl is super nice with Lily!
"," Ted: Yeah she was pretty.
"
" Lily: I will fix it but promise me not to do anything stupid.
"," Ted: I promise to do anything stupid.
"
" Lily: Do you believe? He says it's my fault. And by the way, Ted, I bet she go out with you again.
"," Ted: I'm thinking. Do I want to date a girl that Barney was typed?Help me for harmonies. Of course.
"
" Robin: I'll fetch the newspaper.
"," Ted: Or rather, look for a husband.
"
" Robin: You must stop, seriously. The last thing I'm looking for now is a relationship.
"," Ted: Taking the newspaper, think to watch the ads for marriages.For yours.
"
" Robin: Sorry to interrupt but check it out.
"," Ted: No.
"
" End flashback
"," Ted: Oh, my god, it's horrible. I wonder if it works.
"
" Woman: And what happens after it?
"," Ted: He starts singing and objects come alive and dance with him.
"
" A knock on the door. Ted will open. Barney comes into diving suit.
"," Ted: Apparently, it will rain.
"
" Marshall: She is getting married.
"," Ted: I will prepare my toast.
"
" Robin: It's a good guy.
"," Ted: Come on, go out with him.
"
" Robin: It says what?
"," Ted: It's The Diver.
"
" Robin: I will not fall in love with him.
"," Ted: Yes, because it is... this kind.
"
" Waitress: And for the birthday boy, lasagna.
"," Ted: Thank you.
"
" Waitress: Careful. The plate is very hot.
"," Ted: 'Kay. Oh, go on, touch it.
"
" Lily: Ah! Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.
"," Ted: All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?
"
" Marshall: You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy.
"," Ted: Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time. Barney.
"
" Barney: Ah... Happy birthday, Ted.
"," Ted: Whoo-hoo!
"
" Robin: You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.
"," Ted: Wait for it.
"
" Lily: Still, you know, another year older. Still single. You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking?
"," Ted: Nope. I hit the snooze button.
"
" Barney: Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun. It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys. Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good.
"," Ted: I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.
"
" Lily: Well, what's perfect?
"," Ted: It's not like I have a list.
"
" Robin: Oh, yes, you do.
"," Ted: Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...
"
" Lily: That's not hard. I know at least...
"," Ted: I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.
"
" Marshall: Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.
"," Ted: Any Kim from any cool band, really. Can't be too picky.
"
" Lily: You're never going to find this girl.
"," Ted: Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me. I am done trying to plan the unplannable.
"
" Marshall: So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?
"," Ted: That's the plan.
"
" At the appartment
"," Ted: Whoa, you're up early.
"
" Lily: Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.
"," Ted: Does Marshall know?
"
" Marshall: Awesome. So awesome. God! Best girl ever. Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.
"," Ted: Please don't do that. Hey, is this milk any good?
"
" Marshall: Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.
"," Ted: God, why didn't you throw it away?
"
" At the appartment
"," Ted: Hello?
"
" Man: Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?
"," Ted: Speaking.
"
" Man: Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir? Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions. You signed up for our services about six months ago.
"," Ted: Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.
"
" At Love Solutions
"," Ted: I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?
"
" Bob: Well, my firm bought out the company. You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate, but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so... here I am.
"," Ted: So I'm in good hands. You found me a match?
"
" Bob: There she is. Your soul mate. That'll be 500 bucks.
"," Ted: No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.
"
" Ted from 2030: So I read the file. And by God, this woman was perfect. She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina, she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword, she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna, her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl.
"," Ted: All right, fine. Set it up.
"
" (Ted's phone starts ringing, he picks up)
"," Ted: Lily?
"
" Lily: Hey, Ted, are you busy?
"," Ted: Um... yes.
"
" Lily: Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot. Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?
"," Ted: What? What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?
"
" Lily: Marshall can't know about this. Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story. Can you please hurry?
"," Ted: I can't, I'm waiting...
"
" Lily: Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand? No, drifter, no!
"," Ted: Come on, Lily.
"
" Lily: But you see my point.
"," Ted: All right, stay there. I'm on my way.
"
" Lily: Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date?
"," Ted: Yes.
"
" Lily: And was she okay about pushing it back?
"," Ted: Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?
"
" Lily: You can never tell Marshall.
"," Ted: I won't.
"
" Lily: Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.
"," Ted: I swear on Luke and Leia.
"
" Lily: About a month ago, I started getting insomnia. Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time. But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.
"," Ted: Did you talk to Marshall about it?
"
" Lily: He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...
"," Ted: That was you? Awesome!
"
" Lily: I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.
"," Ted: Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.
"
" Lily: San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven.
"," Ted: You don't want to get married.
"
" Lily: Of course I want to get married. I... It's not like I was ever going to do it. I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.
"," Ted: Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means.
"
" Lily: Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid.
"," Ted: I don't think you're stupid.
"
" Lily: I love Marshall.
"," Ted: I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.
"
" At Duchess County
"," Ted: All done.
"
" Lily: Ted, let's go to New Haven.
"," Ted: Lily, don't do this to yourself.
"
" Lily: I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure.
"," Ted: No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.
"
" Lily: Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, ""Yep. That was a mistake."" So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you?
"," Ted: I don't know. You said ""mistake"" a lot. Lily, don't do this.
"
" Lily: Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.
"," Ted: Forgive you for what? (Lily leaves with he car) Lily. Lily! Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road. I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk... Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you. And, also, I texted you the same thing. (He calls Barney) Hey, I need a big favor.
"
" Barney: Anything, bro.
"," Ted: I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.
"
" Barney: No.
"," Ted: It's kind of an emergency.
"
" Barney: What are you doing in Duchess County?
"," Ted: Apple picking. Can you just get up here?
"
" Marshall: Don't you have a big date tonight?
"," Ted: Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.
"
" Marshall: So what are you doing in Duchess County?
"," Ted: Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!
"
" Marshall: Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you.
"," Ted: No!
"
" Marshall: Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.
"," Ted: No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank. I'm not in Duchess County.
"
" Marshall: So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County?
"," Ted: Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.
"
" Robin: Need a ride, cowboy?
"," Ted: Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.
"
" Robin: Hmm, too bad. I got candy.
"," Ted: Candy?!
"
" Robin: So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?
"," Ted: Nope. Sworn to secrecy.
"
" Robin: Oh, come on.
"," Ted: I like your hat.
"
" Robin: Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights.
"," Ted: Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine.
"
" Robin: Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took ""highlights"" to mean, ""I want to look like a tiger,"" hence the hat.
"," Ted: Oh. I gotta see this.
"
" Robin: No way.
"," Ted: Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat!
"
" Robin: So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?
"," Ted: Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.
"
" Robin: Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.
"," Ted: Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.
"
" Robin: I read that. More like ""Love in the Time of Don't Bothera.""
"," Ted: You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.
"
" Robin: We're not indoors. We're in a van.
"," Ted: Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.
"
" Robin: Never. What else?
"," Ted: She loves lasagna.
"
" Robin: Barf.
"," Ted: You know, I am sensing a pattern here.
"
" Robin: What else?
"," Ted: Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.
"
" Robin: And she's looking to get married and have kids?
"," Ted: Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl.
"
" Robin: Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids.
"," Ted: Really? You don't want kids?
"
" Robin: You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8:56. You're early.
"," Ted: Hey, thanks for picking me up.
"
" Robin: Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for.
"," Ted: Thanks.
"
" Robin: All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.
"," Ted: You're going to show me your hair?
"
" Robin: Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.
"," Ted: You just made my night.
"
" Marshall: Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice. Oh, hey, dude.
"," Ted: Hey, guys.
"
" Lily: Hi.
"," Ted: Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?
"
" Lily: Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.
"," Ted: You think you might want to... drink the milk?
"
" Marshall: Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date. How'd it go, dude?
"," Ted: I didn't go.
"
" Marshall: What? Why?
"," Ted: I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.
"
" Marshall: Why? She sounds perfect.
"," Ted: I don't want perfect. I want Robin.
"
" Marshall: Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake.
"," Ted: Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make.
"
" Lily: Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.
"," Ted: Hey, is this milk any good?
"
" Everyone has secrets. Some are nice.
"," Ted: You know how to make crepes? That is so cool.
"
" Robin: And then there was Derek and counting you, that puts the total up to...
"," Ted: Oh, I got your total...counting along...
"
" Future Ted VO: And some are just weird.
"," Ted: You're scared of the Seven Dwarfs?
"
" Robin: Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going.
"," Ted: What? Why not?
"
" Robin: No, I'm really not gonna go.
"," Ted: Come on, it'll be fun.
"
" (Barney, Lily, Marshall walk closer to Robin and talk over each other)
"," Ted: Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls. If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to. I think we should all just respect her privacy.
"
" (Ted and Robin lie in bed together)
"," Ted: So, what's the deal with you and malls?
"
" Robin: You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to.
"," Ted: Yeah, with those people. I'm your boyfriend. Come on, what is it? Did you get arrested in a mall?
"
" Robin: No.
"," Ted: Dumped in a mall?
"
" Robin: Ted.
"," Ted: Found out you were Canadian at a mall?
"
" Robin: Let it go.
"," Ted: Trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Robin: Let it go.
"
" Ted: Trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Robin: Let it go.
"," Ted: Mauled at the mall?
"
" (Lily, Marshall, Ted and Barney sit around booth)
"," Ted: What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?
"
" Barney: So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible.
"," Ted: I disagree. If there's some potential 'oh' moment, I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative?
"
" (Ted lifts Robin's veil)
"," Ted: I love you.
"
" Barney: You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox.
"," Ted: It's true. They tell each other everything.
"
" Marshall: I'm not afraid of Sasquatch. I just think we should all be on alert.
"," Ted: Trust me, not only do they tell each other everything. They want to know everything.
"
" Barney: Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?
"," Ted: You know?
"
" Barney: Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p0rn, wait for it, ography.
"," Ted: Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous.
"
" Lily: I don't know, he could be right. She does have the fake orgasm noises down.
"," Ted: Hey.
"
" Lily: What? The walls are thin.
"," Ted: That's not what I'm hey-ing you about.
"
" Marshall: You know what it might be. This is gonna sound a little crazy but what if robin's married?
"," Ted: Married? What does have to do with the mall?
"
" Marshall: Just meet with the guy.
"," Ted: She's not married. Robin hates marriage.
"
" Lily: No, because before Robin moved to New York, she...What was she doing?
"," Ted: Well, I don't know, whenever I ask her about Canada, she kinda clams up.
"
" (back to present scene)
"," Ted: So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada?
"
" Barney: Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it.
"," Ted: Thank you Barney.
"
" Barney: 'Cause it's p0rn.
"," Ted: I need another beer.
"
" Barney: I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet.
"," Ted: Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid.
"
" (Ted comes back and sits down at booth)
"," Ted: All right, what if I ask Robin point-blank if she has a husband?
"
" Lily: You said you would respect her privacy so maybe you should just drop it.
"," Ted: Yeah, you're right.
"
" (Robin and Ted sit on ground around table playing Scrabble, Ted plays a word)
"," Ted: Husband.
"
" Robin: There's no 'p' in husband.
"," Ted: Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands.
"
" (Robin looks at Ted)
"," Ted: Fine, I'll take it back.
"
" (Ted takes back his tiles)
"," Ted: Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada.
"
" Robin: Huh.
"," Ted: I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that?
"
" Robin: Ted, I don't understand why you can't...
"," Ted: Just say, ""no, I'm not married.""
"
" Robin: I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married.
"," Ted: Oh.
"
" (return from commercial break)
"," Ted: You have a husband? Robin: I was young and stupid and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall and I haven't been to a mall since.
"
" Ted: You have a husband? Robin: I was young and stupid and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall and I haven't been to a mall since.
"," Ted: Why didn't you get divorced?
"
" Robin: He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough.
"," Ted: Good... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough.
"
" Robin: I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this.
"," Ted: OK.
"
" Lily: I can't believe you told us Robin's secret.
"," Ted: How can I keep something like that to myself? And you begged me to tell you.
"
" Lily: Please tell us, just tell us. I'm begging you. Tell us, tell us, tell us, please, please, please, please, please.
"," Ted: Fine, Robin's married.
"
" Lily: Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us. I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you?
"," Ted: See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?
"
" Barney: I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress.
"," Ted: What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce?
"
" Lily: Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage. It's like their money or their army. Nobody takes it seriously.
"," Ted: It's serious to me.
"
" (Marshall enters through front door, Ted working at his drafting table)
"," Ted: Hey.
"
" Marshall: Hey. Listen, dude, I gotta talk to you, but you gotta promise me that you won't tell Barney.
"," Ted: Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it?
"
" Marshall: Robin's not married.
"," Ted: What? Then, why would she tell me she was?
"
" Marshall: I don't know but I cross-checked every record in Canada. There's no record of her ever being married.
"," Ted: There must be some mistake.
"
" Marshall: I promise you, she's not married. She's not great at parking legally either.
"," Ted: So, she lied to me? What, what am I gonna do? I can't confront her 'cause then she'll know I told you.
"
" (Ted and Robin in apartment talking)
"," Ted: Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest.
"
" Robin: Thanks Ted.
"," Ted: Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is.
"
" Robin: I say we just move on.
"," Ted: In order for me to get total closure on this whole my-girlfriend-has-a-husband thing, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more information. Like, what month did you get married? Robin: June. We had a June wedding.
"
" Ted: In order for me to get total closure on this whole my-girlfriend-has-a-husband thing, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more information. Like, what month did you get married? Robin: June. We had a June wedding.
"," Ted: Ah, Canada in June. That's great.
"
" Ted: Ah, Canada in June. That's great.
"," Ted: Sit down or buffet.
"
" Robin: Um...
"," Ted: Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember.
"
" Robin: No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc.
"," Ted: Hm. Band of DJ?
"
" Robin: String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.
"," Ted: How many bridesmaids? Robin: Seven.
"
" Ted: How many bridesmaids? Robin: Seven.
"," Ted: Flowers? Robin: Azaleas.
"
" Ted: Flowers? Robin: Azaleas.
"," Ted: Color scheme?
"
" Robin: Dusty rose and sienna.
"," Ted: Husband's name?
"
" Robin: Um.
"," Ted: You were never married.
"
" Robin: Yes I was.
"," Ted: No you weren't.
"
" Robin: How do you know?
"," Ted: I looked it up at the library.
"
" Robin: What library?
"," Ted: The one on 5th.
"
" Robin: When did you go?
"," Ted: Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad....
"
" Robin: I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use?
"," Ted: I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.
"
" Robin: You told Marshall?
"," Ted: You lied to me!
"
" Robin: See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret.
"," Ted: But it was a fake secret.
"
" Robin: Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too.
"," Ted: Testing me, that's insane.
"
" Robin: Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world?
"," Ted: That wasn't a real secret.
"
" Robin: Yeah, but it could have been.
"," Ted: You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.
"
" (Ted and Robin talking)
"," Ted: I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.
"
" Barney: So I just got a very interesting phone call.
"," Ted: What are you talking about?
"
" Barney: Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this.
"," Ted: Yeah. No I don't.
"
" Barney: What?
"," Ted: Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.
"
" Barney: Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right.
"," Ted: No, Barney, I said we're not watching this.
"
" (Barney stops video)
"," Ted: Oh my God.
"
" Robin: What the hell was that?
"," Ted: I slap bet Marshall that you did p0rn, so I win.
"
" Marshall: Looks like someone suffered from premature slapulation
"," Ted: Oh my God, Robin's rapping. Guys, Robin's rapping.
"
" Marshall, Ted: Cool.
"," Ted: Go with the 10 now.
"
" Robin: No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?
"," Ted: Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.
"
" Robin: Good call.
"," Ted: Horrible call.
"
" Barney: Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin: I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket.
"," Ted: Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone.
"
" Robin Sparkles: But, baby, I don't wanna wait.
"," Ted: No, she doesn't wanna wait.
"
" Marshall offers a big present to Ted.
"," Ted: Wow! What's this?
"
" Ted opens the box.
"," Ted: A fedora! (he puts it on his head and pulls out a whip) I'm Indiana Jones! I'm Indiana Jones!!

" (Ted runs over to the swords, picks up a sword)
"," Ted: We were bros! These swords represent our bro-hood. And you took 'em down to make room for your fiance's stupid painting?
"
" (Marshall picks up other sword) Marshall: Lily's a part of who I am. And if you're such a bro, she's a part of who you are too. She's a bro by extension.
"," Ted: I deserve this apartment, Marshall.
"
" (Marshall taps Ted's sword with his sword)
"," Ted: Great, so let's flip for it.
"
" (Ted gets ready to flip coin, Ted and Marshall start sword fighting)
"," Ted: So, is this how we're deciding who gets the apartment?
"
" Marshall: I guess so.
"," Ted: How are we doing this exactly? Is this like to the death?
"
" (Marshall swipes at Ted, Ted jumps back and falls into chair)
"," Ted: It's OK, it's OK.
"
" (Ted gets up and goes to other side of room)
"," Ted: Can I observe something?
"
" Marshall: That this is kinda awesome?
"," Ted: Totally.
"
" Marshall: I can't believe we didn't do this before.
"," Ted: I know!
"
" Marshall: That was awesome.
"," Ted: I know.
"
" Marshall: Do it again.
"," Ted: OK, but this time, jump up and I'll swipe your legs.
"
" (Marshall and Ted hit swords, Ted spins around and they hit swords again, Marshall jumps up and Ted swipes sword beneath his feet, the continue sword fight)
"," Ted: Look. Here's why I should get the place. You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates. And on top of that I could be homeless. Does that seem fair?
"
" Marshall: Oh, boo-freakin-hoo.
"," Ted: What?
"
" Marshall: Woe is me. I'm not married yet. My ovaries are shrinking. Ted, if you wanted to be married by now you would be but you're not. And you know why? Because you're irrationally picky. You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.
"," Ted: Anhedonic?
"
" Marshall: Anhedonic. It means you can't enjoy anything.
"," Ted: The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this.
"
" Marshall: Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down.
"," Ted: That's OK, it led to this totally rad sword fight, didn't it?
"
" Marshall: You remember when we first got these swords?
"," Ted: It was the day we moved in.
"
" (flashback to day they moved in, Marshall is assembling coffee table, Ted just mounted swords on wall)
"," Ted: Congratulations, Marshall. We live in an apartment with swords on the wall.
"
" Marshall: List of lifelong dreams, you're not half as long. Crap. I'm missing one of the screws for this table
"," Ted: Just use this wood glue, it'll hold.
"
" Marshall: I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fiancé.
"," Ted: Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fiancé? I'm kidding. Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment. Marshall: But you fought so bravely for it.
"
" Ted: Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fiancé? I'm kidding. Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment. Marshall: But you fought so bravely for it.
"," Ted: I wasn't fighting for the apartment. I was fighting for...I don't know...for everything to stay the way it is. But I'm not gonna get that, so, seriously, take the place, it's yours.
"
" Robin: But you're totally...
"," Ted: Just let him have this one.
"
" Marshall: You're right. I'm sorry. We were fighting to see who gets the apartment. And I won.
"," Ted: Uh, you didn't win. I gave it to you.
"
" Lily: I will too. We're not getting married for like a year.
"," Ted: Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem. Let that guy deal with it.

"," Ted: Wedding's over.
"
" Robin: Yes, it is.
"," Ted: I guess starting tomorrow, we can tell people.
"
" Barney: Tell people what?
"," Ted: The food looks delicious, doesn't it?
"
" Barney: Oh, okay. Tell people what?
"," Ted: Can we talk about this later?
"
" Barney: Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what?
"," Ted: Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?
"
" Barney: Okay. (Barney leaves)
"," Ted: Whoo, that was a close one.
"
" Robin: Oh, God! Okay. Look, we have some... news.
"," Ted: But we don't want to draw attention away from Lily and Marshall's big day.
"
" Barney: Fine.
"," Ted: It's pretty big, though.
"
" Robin: All right, let's run some interference.
"," Ted: Yeah, we'll get you back to your table. Come on.
"
" Lily: Oh, yes, definitely.
"," Ted: How about a slide show of you guys through the years set to Green Day's ""Time of Your Life"" and ending with your baby photos side by side.
"
" Lily: We've done it. A wedding with zero clichées.
"," Ted: Wait, isn't doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a clichée?
"
" Barney: Are those mini quiches? (Marshall and Lily run) Tell the secret.
"," Ted: Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?
"
" Barney: Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew.
"," Ted: What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives.
"
" Waiter: Compliments of the house.
"," Ted: Wow. Thanks. Cheers.
"
" Barney: Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away.(Lily and Marshall leave) So what was in the glass?
"," Ted: Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, ""Champagne?"" ""We didn't order any champagne."" ""Compliments of the house."" ""Wow.""
"
" this to me. No. No, no, no!
"," Ted: That's what she said.
"
" Robin: No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no.
"," Ted: What are you talking about?
"
" Robin: This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here.
"," Ted: That's not mine.
"
" Robin: What?
"," Ted: That's not mine.
"
" Robin: Wow. That was hilarious. I was like... what? Anyway.
"," Ted: What the hell was that?
"
" Robin: What the hell was what?
"," Ted: That reaction?
"
" Robin: I thought you were proposing to me.
"," Ted: Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire.
"
" Robin: Ted, you know how I feel about marriage.
"," Ted: Now more than ever.
"
" Robin: I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight?
"," Ted: No.
"
" Robin: Then why is this an issue?
"," Ted: Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, ""No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. ""Ted, you cannot do this to me. ""No. No, no, no.""
"
" Robin: Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go?
"," Ted: No.
"
" Lily: I had four strawberries.
"," Ted: Was there a side of champagne with each of the strawberries?
"
" Robin: Ted, don't do this.
"," Ted: No, seriously. Where do you see yourself in five years?
"
" Robin: Where do you see yourself?
"," Ted: Honestly, in five years... I probably want to be married.
"
" Robin: And I probably want to be in Argentina.
"," Ted: Argentina?
"
" Robin: Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure.
"," Ted: We have an expiration date, don't we?
"
" Barney: Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it.
"," Ted: Barney... story's not over.
"
" Robin: Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home?
"," Ted: Yeah, of course. Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this. Can we actually...
"
" Waiter: Oh, my God, it's you.
"," Ted: Wha... what?
"
" Waiter: You're the son of a bitch who stole our blue French horn.
"," Ted: Run!
"
" Barney: Run? Your strategy was run?
"," Ted: It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it.
"
" Ted and Robin run and knock down the tray that the waiter was holding, at Robin's apartment...
"," Ted: I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license till we bring the horn back.
"
" Flashback, at the restaurant...
"," Ted: Look, I'm sorry about the French horn. I want to make this right. So what we're going to do right now is, we're going to run!
"
" Ted runs and fall. End of flashback..
"," Ted: So... Argentina.
"
" Robin: Argentina.
"," Ted: Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina?
"
" Robin: Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there.
"," Ted: I could want to live in Argentina.
"
" Robin: No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does.
"," Ted: Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too. They have buildings in Argentina. And Paris. And even Tokyo. I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.
"
" Robin: So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?
"," Ted: Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina.
"
" Robin: Oh, shut up.
"," Ted: You're scared I might not be kidding.
"
" Robin: Aren't you?
"," Ted: Nope. Your move, Scherbatsky.
"
" Barney: You caught the bouquet?
"," Ted: Barney. The story's not over yet.
"
" Robin: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
"," Ted: What?
"
" Robin: I don't know if I can do this to you.
"," Ted: Do what?
"
" Robin: Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids.
"," Ted: Oh, right. 'Cause there are no kids there. On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black ""X"" over Argentina.
"
" Robin: You know what I mean.
"," Ted: No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect.
"
" Robin: Well, we probably shouldn't.
"," Ted: Yeah.
"
" Robin: Risk it?
"," Ted: Risk it.
"
" Man: God, this guy's giving me nothing.
"," Ted: All right, have fun in Scotland. If you see the Loch Ness Monster, tell him Ted Mosby says, ""What's up?""
"
" Marshall: Nessie's a she, Ted, come on. Marshall and Lily leave.
"," Ted: Hey, kiddo.
"
" BarneyYou are going to miss out on a lot of awesome stuff. You'll be at home with the kid while I am out awesome-ing all over the place. And you're going to get fat.
"," Ted: The story's not over, Barney.
"
" Flashback
"," Ted: Okay, time to get the horn back to the bistro.
"
" Robin: Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again. That tuckered me out.
"," Ted: Not a euphemism.
"
" Robin: Right. Okay, let me just go change, and we'll leave.
"," Ted: Whoa, whoa, you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh. Solidarity, sister.
"
" Robin: That is crazy. I have a change of clothes and you don't. Suck it up.
"," Ted: Well, if we'd actually moved in together, all my stuff would be here, but we didn't, so...
"
" Robin: Yeah. We were all talk, weren't we?
"," Ted: We're not doing this, are we?
"
" Robin: I don't want to have kids in Argentina.
"," Ted: And I don't want to have kids in Argentina.
"
" Robin: So where does that leave us?
"," Ted: Well... we could stay together and... pretend this stuff doesn't matter. Or... we could give back the blue French horn.
"
" Robin: You stole a blue French horn for me.
"," Ted: I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.
"
" Barney: You did break up.
"," Ted: Yep.
"
" Barney: An-And Marshall and Lily don't know?
"," Ted: Well, afterwards, uh, we came by to tell you guys, but Lily was pretty stressed out, so...
"
" Barney: You guys okay?
"," Ted: Well, it hasn't been the easiest two weeks of our lives, but...
"
" Robin: But we're okay.
"," Ted: The open bar helps.
"
" Kid: Could I have this dance?
"," Ted: Well, we knew this day would come eventually. Take care of her, little man.
"
" Barney: I'm really sorry about you and Robin. I know I was always joking around about wanting you two to break up, but you were really good together.
"," Ted: Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know?
"
" Barney: The one. Oh, Ted, no. Do not tell me you're going to start searching for ""the one"" again. The only time I want to hear you saying ""the one"" is if it's followed by the word ""hundredth."" What up?
"," Ted: No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know?
"
" Barney: Really? 'Cause... you know, you've been in a relationship for a year. You're going to... be a little rusty.
"," Ted: Yeah.
"
" Barney: I'm just saying... you're gonna need, need, need some help out there.
"," Ted: Could be.
"
" Barney: Ted?
"," Ted: Yes, Barney.
"
" Barney: Do you think... Do you think maybe you might... need a wingman again?
"," Ted: I do.
"
" At Marvin's funeral
"," Ted: This is the toughest time in Marshall's life and I feel absolutely useless. What can we do to help?
"
" Robin: Well, uh, I've been to a couple funerals, so I know my role: I'm Vice Girl. Whatever Marshall needs to get through this day, I got it right here.
"," Ted: Cigarettes, alcohol... Are these firecrackers? My God, Robin, you somehow crammed Tijuana into a purse.
"
" Lily: Okay, yes, Judy and I aren't besties, but today, whatever she needs, I'm there. I'm on Judy duty.
"," Ted: ""Judy duty.""
"
" Robin: Really, guys? At a funeral?
"," Ted: Uh, okay, while not all of us possess your lofty sense of decorum, Drug-DealerFrom-An-'80s-After-School-Special, we have to laugh today. It's healthy.
"
" Barney: Ted, what's the one thing that always cracks him up?
"," Ted: Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts.
"
" Barney: Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts, exactly! So we are gonna get our bro a four-star nad rattler. You search knees, feet, banisters, fire hydrants and diving boards, and I'll cover bats, rackets, hockey sticks, golf clubs and riding crops.
"," Ted: What about animals?
"
" Lily: Wow, you really do have everything in there, don't you?
"," Ted: You're like Mary Poppins, if her magic purse was also filled with drugs.
"
" Barney: Marshall Eriksen, you could use a laugh.
"," Ted: Yeah! This video is entitled, ""Little League Coach Gets Hit in the Nuts by a Foul Ball and Then Vomits in a Garbage Can."" I don't wanna give anything away. Let's just watch.
"
" Barney: See? 'Cause, 'cause he got hit...
"," Ted:...right in the nuts,
"
" Marshall: Trey Platt. I can't believe my father's funeral service is being led by Trey ""The Noogie Machine"" Platt.
"," Ted: That guy gave you noogies? What, did he carry a stepladder?
"
" Barney: This next clip is entitled, ""Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets Hit in the Nuts by Low-Flying Seagull""
"," Ted: Let's see what happens.
"
" Barney: Here he comes... Oh! Oh! 'Cause he gets hit right in the nuts.
"," Ted: And then the fat kid loses his swim trunks.
"
" Robin: You should listen to it. Just don't put too much pressure on it.
"," Ted: She's right. I mean, this idea that someone's last words have to be profound and meaningful? I mean, who can live up to that?
"
" Robin: The point is, last words are overrated.
"," Ted: Look, think of it this way: you get to hear your dad's voice one last time.
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Ted: Whoa. Are you okay?
"
" Lily: Judy's finally sleeping and it's all because of me! Guys, I have a role: I'm Judy's bitch! Yeah!
"," Ted: Well, but this day is tough on you, too. You sure you can absorb all that?
"
" Marshall: Guys, guys, what if-- God forbid-- all of your dads died right now? What would their last words to you have been? Seriously.
"," Ted: I know mine. When I was in Cleveland last month, I went to visit my dad at his... post-divorce bachelor pad.
"
" Ted's dad: Been fun bro-ing out with you tonight, T-Dawg.
"," Ted: Yeah... so glad we can we can talk about our s*x lives now. That's totally an improvement.

" Ted's dad: I hooked up with a younger woman the other week-- Donna Bromstead.
"," Ted: My prom date?!
"
" Ted's dad: How far did you get, T-Dawg?
"," Ted: I have to go.
"
" Marshall: How would you like those to be your father's last words?
"," Ted: Well, they might be. Donna Bromstead's husband is a cop.
"
" [END OF FLASHBACK]
"," Ted: That's awful.
"
" Lily: That salad's the first food she's eaten in two days. Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise and jelly beans, but it counts.
"," Ted: Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Marshall laugh once.
"
" Barney: Yeah. Showing videos of guys getting hit in the nuts wasn't going to do anything. I'm just stupid.
"," Ted: Stupid.
"
" Barney: What we need to do is hit each other in the nuts.
"," Ted: Yes. Nothing beats the immediacy of live theater. But which one of us is going to take the hit?(Barney hits Ted in the nuts) So that's it? No discussion?
"
" Marshall: I'm not going to listen. ""Rent Crocodile Dundee II"" are the last words that my father will ever say to me, and I think I can live with that.
"," Ted: Is he laughing?
"
" Barney, his voice breaking: Lame.
"," Ted: These stories suck.
"

"," Ted: I can't design the building.
"
" Barney: You're kidding me.
"," Ted: I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave?
"
" Barney: Snakes.
"," Ted: Did you just say ""snakes""?
"
" Barney: I don't recall saying ""snakes"". Ted, I know you love crappy old stuff no one cares about. But I'm gonna give you four words to live by: New is always better.
"," Ted: New is always better?
"
" Barney: You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better.
"," Ted: Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?
"
" Barney: Everything.
"," Ted: So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?
"
" Barney: Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law.
"," Ted: And when you're at a Guns n' Roses concert, you're like, ""Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy""?
