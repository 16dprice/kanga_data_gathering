{"prompt":" Barney: All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?\n","completion":" Ted: Yes.\n"}

{"prompt":" (Ted picks up his keys)\n","completion":" Ted: Got 'em.\n"}
{"prompt":" Rachel: Hey, are these your roommates?\n","completion":" Ted: Yes, yes, but they are not here. They are somewhere else. We have total privacy because privacy is essential when you're listening to music.\n"}

{"prompt":" Barney: Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me.\n","completion":" Ted: See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn.\n","completion":" Ted: It won't?\n"}

{"prompt":" Robin: Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.\n","completion":" Ted: What's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.\n"}

{"prompt":" Robin: Do you want to come over?\n","completion":" Ted: Why? What's up?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like, \"You know who likes juice? Ted.\"\n","completion":" Ted: I love juice.\n"}

{"prompt":" Robin: Yes, we'll juice.\n","completion":" Ted: Okay.\n"}

{"prompt":" Cab driver: Nice.\n","completion":" Ted: No, it's not like that. We're juicing as friends. See, I have this girlfriend, I would never cheat on her. She lives in Germany. See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk. I still haven't heard from her. I don't know. Sorry to bug you with my problems. Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh?\n"}
{"prompt":" Cab driver: You ain't kidding, kid. Want a nip?\n","completion":" Ted: You can just let me out right up here.\n"}
{"prompt":" Cab driver: Where you going to, buddy?\n","completion":" Ted: Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth. Okay, here's where I left off with the last guy. See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over to this other girl's house...\n"}

{"prompt":" Victoria: Right. You're going to go make some juice.\n","completion":" Ted: Yes, yes! Juice is perfectly harmless. In fact, it's healthy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria: Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering what she looks like naked?\n","completion":" Ted: I am not won... Okay, even if I am wondering that, it's only 'cause you put it in my head.\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria: Ah, but I'm just a manifestation of your subconscious, so actually, you put it in your own head.\n","completion":" Ted: Damn it! Nothing's going to happen.\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria: Right.\n","completion":" Ted: Okay, okay. You want a second opinion? Fine.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Hey, did she call?\n","completion":" Ted: No. I need a ruling. Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but I'm on my way over to Robin's right now. She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out.\n"}
{"prompt":" In the cab\n","completion":" Ted: Come on, pick up. Damn it, Victoria, where are you? Pick up, pick up!\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria: Cupcake?\n","completion":" Ted: No, thanks. Where are you? Why haven't you called?\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria: Oh, I'm out hooking up... with three other guys. Or maybe I'm a devoted girlfriend and I'm calling you right now.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. Why do I doubt that? Hello.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Ted, I just saw the news and a truck carrying sulphuric acid overturned right in front of Robin's house. And it's melting through the sidewalk. You can see straight down into hell. It's bad. You should go home, dude.\n","completion":" Ted: Marshall, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Ted, what does your mom always say?\n","completion":" Ted: Nothing good ever...\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m. Go home! It's too late for juice.\n","completion":" Ted: Dude, Robin and I are just friends. She doesn't even like me that way.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.\n","completion":" Ted: What?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: It's a big secret, so don't tell her I told you, but she's very vulnerable right now and you have a girlfriend. Go home, Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: She-she likes me?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Yes. So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there. Go home, Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: She likes me?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Go home, Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted from 2030: I did have more sense than that.\n","completion":" Ted: Keep the change.\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria: So you're doing this? You're going up there?\n","completion":" Ted: You want to get out of the way?\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria: I'm not in the way.\n","completion":" Ted: You know, if you had just called me, I...\n"}

{"prompt":" Robin: Thanks.\n","completion":" Ted: Make it a big glass.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Sure.\n","completion":" Ted: So, how's it hanging?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore or what the hell you're doing with your life? Do you ever have one of those days?\n","completion":" Ted: Uh, about once a week.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted from 2030: When the clock strikes 2:00, just go to sleep.\n","completion":" Ted: We broke up.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: What?\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. Yeah, she finally called. We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is-- and then... she dumped me.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful.\n","completion":" Ted: You're smiling.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Am I? No I'm not. I'm a news anchor. Smiling's a part of the job. Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today. See? You're smiling, too.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. I have no idea what that's all about.\n"}
{"prompt":" At Robin's\n","completion":" Ted: So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Oh, yeah. Do you like it?\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Wow. Weird.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted goes out in the hall)\n","completion":" Ted: Hello?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Sorry about that.\n","completion":" Ted: Was that Korean Elvis?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's.\n","completion":" Ted: Um... Actually... I'm at Robin's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis, but what the bleep are you doing, dude?\n","completion":" Ted: What do you expect from me? It's Robin. Victoria's great, but, it's Robin. I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Gonna?\n","completion":" Ted: Yes. First thing tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Okay, but, but, as of right now at-at... 2:45 a.m. you still have a girlfriend. Ted, I love you. I love Robin. But if you do this right now, your entire future with her will be built on a crime. Just go home, Ted. Don't do this the wrong way.\n","completion":" Ted: I hate how you're always right.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: It's my best and most annoying trait.\n","completion":" Ted: Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.\n"}

{"prompt":" Robin: Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.\n","completion":" Ted: Can I call you tomorrow?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.\n","completion":" Ted: Okay. Good night, Robin.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Oh, my God. We're making out.\n","completion":" Ted: Right.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: This is crazy.\n","completion":" Ted: Right? Right?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Yeah?\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted goes to the bathroom while Robin waits in the living room)\n","completion":" Ted: Stop doing that.\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria: Whatcha doin'?\n","completion":" Ted: I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria: Okay. Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be? Length of an average pee? No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes. Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive...\n","completion":" Ted: What do you want from me? People break up. It happens.\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria: Not like this. Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with.\n","completion":" Ted: It's not ideal.\n"}
{"prompt":" At Robin's\n","completion":" Ted: You're right. I owe you a real breakup call. I'll call you tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria: Good. So you're gonna go home?\n","completion":" Ted: Why should I have to go home? You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry.\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria: Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Robin. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay.\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria: Oh, please. You just want to get laid.\n","completion":" Ted: Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night.\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria: That's not your phone.\n","completion":" Ted: This isn't my phone.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Okay. Bye. (She hungs up) I thought it was mine, so I answered it.\n","completion":" Ted: Was it...?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Okay! I made a list of awesome baby names. Starting at the top: number one...\n","completion":" Ted: I'm gonna stop you right here, Marshall. You name a chubby white kid \"LeBron,\" and he's the one getting stuffed in the basketball hoop.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: um, how about \"Ryan\"?\n","completion":" Ted: Ooh.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Our DVR won't recognize it as a television program.\n","completion":" Ted: I watched. Robin insisted I confirm how \"awful\" Becky is, so last night I checked it out.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky?\n","completion":" Ted: Mmm... (muttering) I thought she was charming.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: No, she is not my daughter. I'm just her daddy.\n","completion":" Ted: Wow. That is disgusting.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Marshall and Ted go away)\n","completion":" Ted: Marshall, your list is entirely boy names. You do realize there's roughly a 50% chance of you having a daughter, right?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I don't want a girl. I just want a little boy.\n","completion":" Ted: It's not what it sounds like, folks.\n"}
{"prompt":" The Bar\n","completion":" Ted: Ow!\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Ted, of all the women in New York, you had to go out with an eight-year-old girl?\n","completion":" Ted: Not what it sounds like, folks.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Ted, you know that I hate her. How could you go out on a date with this girl?\n","completion":" Ted: It wasn't a date. She came over to the apartment looking for you.\n"}
{"prompt":" Becky: I made Robin my famous chocolate chip cookies. But instead of chocolate chips, I used gummie bears.\n","completion":" Ted: Aww...\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Let me guess: she acted like a helpless little girl, and you stepped in as the big, strong man.\n","completion":" Ted: I don't know if that's totally true.\n"}
{"prompt":" [FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: It's okay, little darlin'.\n"}
{"prompt":" Becky: Poor spider.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Spiders gotta die so trees can grow.\n"}
{"prompt":" [END OF FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: Then I held her tight and told her it was all gonna be okay. By the way, I think I only wounded the spider. It crawled off into my bedroom.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Wait. Is that why you slept on the couch last night?\n","completion":" Ted: (scoffing) Yeah, I slept.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Yeah, we don't care about this...\n","completion":" Ted: No one challenged you, so it wasn't really a challenge.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Challenge accept...\n","completion":" Ted: Wow, I'm glad that's over. It was creepy watching Barney talk like a little kid.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Oh, but you find it irresistible when Becky does? I don't get it. The Ted that I went out with was attracted to the kind of woman who could use a steak knife without supervision.\n","completion":" Ted: For your information, Becky doesn't like steak, she likes pasghetti. Spaghetti. And more importantly, she makes me feel needed.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Needed? (scoffs) She makes training wheels feel needed.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, it's nice to feel needed. And you know what? It's not a feeling guys get when they're with you.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: When we were dating, I... I didn't make you feel needed?\n","completion":" Ted: Come on! You always took charge of everything.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I got this.\n","completion":" Ted: Thanks.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Later, on the couch)\n","completion":" Ted: This okay? Am I hurting y...\n"}
{"prompt":" (Later)\n","completion":" Ted: Someone's trying to break in-- call the cops.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Did that really bother you?\n","completion":" Ted: Well, yeah. It's nice to be needed. Look, I'm sorry. (phone chimes) I didn't mean to upset you. It's Becky. Aw, she's trapped in a revolving door.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I got this.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted is offering an ice cream to Becky\n","completion":" Ted: Shoe's untied. I got it. Yeah, this is over.\n"}
{"prompt":" Future Ted VO: Kids, back in the fall of 2007, I was dating this girl named...oh God, what was her name? It's been 23 years, I can't remember all this stuff. For the sake of the story, let's call her...\n","completion":" Ted: Everyone, this is Blah-blah.\n"}
{"prompt":" Blah-blah: Well, I was taking this cooking class, French fusion, and everyone already had a partner but then I looked up, and across a crowded room, I saw Ted. It was magical.\n","completion":" Ted: It was so magical.\n"}

{"prompt":" Barney: Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes.\n","completion":" Ted: OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me.\n"}

{"prompt":" Barney: I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts...\n","completion":" Ted: She's not crazy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: It's crazy how cute that is. It's crazy.\n","completion":" Ted: You know who else has a really cute story of how they met? Marshall and Lily. You guys should tell that story right now.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Blah-blah gets up and walks over to bar, Barney looks at Ted)\n","completion":" Ted: Anybody'd be stressed out meeting new people. She's not crazy. Crazy generous maybe, buying us drinks.\n"}

{"prompt":" Barney: No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh man, I'm really sorry.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Barney flushes and walks toward sink)\n","completion":" Ted: What? Barney: I just made that up mid-pee. It worked on you, it's definitely gonna work on that blonde chick at the end of the bar. Unless you're a total idiot. What's your name?\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted: What? Barney: I just made that up mid-pee. It worked on you, it's definitely gonna work on that blonde chick at the end of the bar. Unless you're a total idiot. What's your name?\n","completion":" Ted: Ted.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Are you a total idiot, Ted?\n","completion":" Ted: Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Barney: (laughs) Well played.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Barney. We met at the urinal.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh right, hi.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm not wearing a suit.\n"}

{"prompt":" Barney: What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.\n","completion":" Ted: (signing) My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever.\n","completion":" Ted: Barney, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.\n"}
{"prompt":" (flashback to Ted signing to Audrey)\n","completion":" Ted: (signing) He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.\n"}
{"prompt":" Blah-blah: Oh my God, you told them.\n","completion":" Ted: OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Blah-blah gets up and leaves table and walks over to bar)\n","completion":" Ted: Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted and Blah-blah talk over by bar)\n","completion":" Ted: I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Robin.\n"}
{"prompt":" Blah-blah: I'm sorry, it's just Lily and Marshall's story is so romantic. I just wish we had something like that.\n","completion":" Ted: Their story is not as magical as it seems.\n"}
{"prompt":" Blah-blah: What do you mean?\n","completion":" Ted: No, I can't, it's kind of a secret.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Blah-blah whispers in Ted's ear, hot-crazy scale appears with circle in 'crazy' area moving up into the 'hot' area)\n","completion":" Ted: The night before Lily met Marshall, there was this party.\n"}
{"prompt":" (back to present scene)\n","completion":" Ted: As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me.\n"}
{"prompt":" Blah-blah: Oh my God.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, and in all these years Lily and I have never spoken about it, so again, mum's the word, OK?\n"}
{"prompt":" Blah-blah: You have to tell Marshall.\n","completion":" Ted: If he heard that, it would destroy him.\n"}
{"prompt":" Blah-blah: If you don't tell him, I will.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, come on, you wouldn't.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Blah-blah gives Ted a scary look)\n","completion":" Ted: Oh no.\n"}
{"prompt":" Blah-blah: So, Lily, how did you and Ted meet? Come on, Lily, the real story.\n","completion":" Ted: I don't think anyone wants to hear that story.\n"}
{"prompt":" (back top present scene)\n","completion":" Ted: Yes, that is the unabridged story of how Lily and I met. How embarrassing. Who wants another round?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Tell us what?\n","completion":" Ted: Lily, will you help us get the next round?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Ted, what's going on?\n","completion":" Ted: She knows about us, about how we really met.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Yeah, I know, I just told her.\n","completion":" Ted: No, the real story.\n"}

{"prompt":" Lily: Come on what?\n","completion":" Ted: Lily, come on.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Ted, I honestly don't know what you're talking about.\n","completion":" Ted: Lily, come on.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: What? Ted and I never made out.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, we did.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I only made out with one other guy in college before I met Marshall, and it was just some random dude. I don't even remember his name. I just call him too-much-tongue guy.\n","completion":" Ted: What? Too-much-tongue guy? I'm not surprised to hear that coming from unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: That wasn't me.\n","completion":" Ted: Yes it was, at the freshman orientation party.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I'm sorry, who are you again?\n","completion":" Ted: This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed.\n","completion":" Ted: You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference.\n","completion":" Ted: So we should make lots of Star Wars references around girls, that's what you're saying?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Too-much-tongue guy? Yeah.\n","completion":" Ted: And you know that girl I made out with at the freshman orientation party?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl? Yeah.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm too-much-tongue guy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I don't think you need to be. I was at that party. It was dark, and granted, I had eaten quite a few sandwiches but I'm a hundred percent sure that unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl was Alexa Leskies, it's not Lily.\n","completion":" Ted: Really? Marshall: Yeah, I'm positive. And too-much-tongue guy was Colin O'Riley.\n"}
{"prompt":" Blah-blah: (to Ted) You don't really believe that, do you? You swore it was Lily.\n","completion":" Ted: I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa.\n"}
{"prompt":" (back to present scene)\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, it's really, it's a cool game.\n"}
{"prompt":" (flashback of Blah-blah and Ted talking)\n","completion":" Ted: I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa.\n"}
{"prompt":" Alexa: So, Ted, remember the last time we were here?\n","completion":" Ted: You and me? No idea.\n"}
{"prompt":" (flashback to College Ted making out with College Alexa, camera pans to show College Lily kissing another guy)\n","completion":" Ted: That was you?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I know.\n","completion":" Ted: So I am not too-much-tongue guy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Alexa: Actually.\n","completion":" Ted: No.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Marshall pulls a sandwich in a plastic bag out from inside his jacket)\n","completion":" Ted: That is a fat sandwich.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted takes sandwich from Lily)\n","completion":" Ted: I can't believe I used to be able to eat a whole sandwich by myself. Now it's like two bites and I am done.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Marshall, Lily and Ted giggle)\n","completion":" Ted: Where's my wife?\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted is with his friends at McClaren's.\n","completion":" Ted: It's funny when I think about it. I was sure that Stella was good. When she left me, I was so devastated. But you helped me overcome that. Now the hard part is over. I came out a little louder. You know, I do not think further of it. This is the work of time, I guess.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Ted, the wedding was yesterday. It's been 24 hours.\n","completion":" Ted: I know. That's all I advance. A new chapter in my life begins today, and we'll celebrate. Here, we need two things.We need Kool and the Gang. It's time the jukebox!\n"}

{"prompt":" Robin: You wanna hang out?\n","completion":" Ted: Girls, I'm fine.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Dude, you make some?\n","completion":" Ted: I'm fine.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Hey, kid.\n","completion":" Ted: Barney, I'm fine! It is not necessary, and it is rather unhealthy. Sorry, ladies.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted (2030): Finally, after two weeks, emotions eventually overflow.\n","completion":" Ted: What do you want for dinner?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I have not done it, and that's why I took so long to get better. So Ted, I want you explode. Release your rage.Ready? Now!\n","completion":" Ted: It's OK.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Guys, let him go. He is happy. Listen, if Ted was married, then he would be married, he would live in New Jersey, and he would be married. It is well. Good, let's eat. Let Flat Michael's?\n","completion":" Ted: It is between the 44th and Lex. Impossible.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Why?\n","completion":" Ted: It is near the gym Stella. We could cross. Everywhere else, it's going.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Ok, how about Hurley's?\n","completion":" Ted: Stack between his office and dry cleaner. Sorry.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Well, The Meatloaf Charlie?\n","completion":" Ted: Two blocks from her mother's hairdresser.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Okay, Ted, is there a place in Manhattan where one can dine?\n","completion":" Ted: Of course. Look at this.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: It's that thing?\n","completion":" Ted: A reference card I made. A guide to places where you can meet Stella Zinman. The red areas: to avoid. White: OK.Blue: the sea\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: It leaves you on the altar, and it's you who're avoiding?\n","completion":" Ted: Yes, I avoid it. What is the problem? It goes like this.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: It's that \"one\" small dicks?\n","completion":" Ted: No, 'on', it is the people of the great state of Ohio. When life is hard, we take the pain and bury us. And if the pain goes, is buried pain over another. Why cope when you can avoid?All I have to do is to never see her again, and I will have a long happy life. So who wants to eat?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Someone told me of a tapas bar located in the white zone.\n","completion":" Ted: Super. Let's go.\n"}
{"prompt":" Waiter: Have you decided?\n","completion":" Ted: Not yet. Can we have almonds to the table?\n"}
{"prompt":" Waiter: Certainly.\n","completion":" Ted: Well done, Lily. This place looks cool. That you talked about?\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted turns around and sees Stella.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh my God! Oh my God! OK, stay cool. We'll just have to manage it. Everyone... follow me.\n"}
{"prompt":" Everyone is hiding under the table.\n","completion":" Ted: Think, think. Guys, stay there. I'll take a look. Marshall will look.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: She took to win.\n","completion":" Ted: She looks happy? She talked about me? I do not care.Where are the almonds?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: You're maybe Ohio, but you live in New York now. We do not bury our emotions in New York. We take our emotions and they are sent to the other side!\n","completion":" Ted: Let me go. You'd do the same if you were in this situation.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I dream! There's not one person on Earth to which I would hide under a table.\n","completion":" Ted: Really, not one? Not even... Gazeur?\n"}
{"prompt":" Server: It's going guys?\n","completion":" Ted: Let's just eat here, if possible.\n"}
{"prompt":" Server: This is your almonds.\n","completion":" Ted: Thank you. You have a daily special?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: I am a person who... Well, are facing. There are a bunch of people I do not want to see... as the group of \"girls that I skipped\"... but if one of them came here, I would stay there, and I would look into his eyes. For some, this would be the first time.\n","completion":" Ted: Really, you hide from anybody? Not even... Becca Delucci?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Becca is this girl who lives in the North. I saw her from time to time.\n","completion":" Ted: Where exactly in the north, Barney?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Now I have letters from Becca who say, \"I'll come see you the day I get out of here. I'll hang your eyes in my rearview mirror. \"Women, eh?\n","completion":" Ted: You see? Are you afraid of Becca. Lily is afraid of Gazeur. (Marshall head out from under the table) are still under the table.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: We do not need. Stella is a party.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, my God. That's it, and that's it, the style Ohio. The problem manifested itself. It has been avoided. It is a party.Here you can dine in peace...\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: If the last person I wanted to see, came in I would not talk to him.\n","completion":" Ted: Really?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: He wanted a son and the fact that I am a girl has not changed.\n","completion":" Ted: How so?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what? \"I wish not to be raised as a boy, that thou teach me not to hunt, fish and smoke cigars and drinking scotch because girls do not do that. And you know why I run like a girl? Because I am one. \"\n","completion":" Ted: You kept it for quite some time, eh?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Yes.\n","completion":" Ted: It has returned to you.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted (2030): And I realized... all my friends were haunted, but there was a difference between my and their ghosts. It was not too late for me.\n","completion":" Ted: I'll talk to him. (They go out from under the table, but Stella is gone) She's gone. I'll catch up.\n"}
{"prompt":" They leave the restaurant and the taxi from Stella.\n","completion":" Ted: There she is!\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted, Barney, Robin, Marshall and Lily are in a taxi.\n","completion":" Ted: I see. It is two taxis right front. Not lose it, OK?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Well, well you do. You're going to confront it.\n","completion":" Ted: I will face it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: This is so exciting.\n","completion":" Ted: Bluntly.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: You're gonna say what?\n","completion":" Ted: I will say, \"Sorry it did not work. \"We will discuss in adults. She'll tell me his views and... I will listen. What I should have done more before.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: You have to get angry. Go ahead. Looking good.\n","completion":" Ted: Come on. There is no question of moving his arms, stomping feet and get angry. This is Stella and I finally communicating. Clearly, it was...\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Stella hated Star Wars. She lied to you. Seeking your feelings. You know it's true.\n","completion":" Ted: That's his problem.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I understand!\n","completion":" Ted: In the name of all that is sacred...\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Why take it away to bring him back in New Jersey, anyway?\n","completion":" Ted: Maybe she goes to his office.\n"}
{"prompt":" End flashback\n","completion":" Ted: If she goes to her, why you go to...? Oh, my God. Tony lives in the city center. \"At home\" is Tony's apartment. She would move in with me in New Jersey and moved to town, Tony? The bitch!\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Finally. Finally, my friend.\n","completion":" Ted: I have the balls too!\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I know and I love it! It's great! Sir, we will pay gladly handle that has been broken. I love Ted angry!\n","completion":" Ted: Me too!\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: She stops.\n","completion":" Ted: That's it. That's it!\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily:... and that you face all that, but... you only have one chance. Take a moment and think about what you will say.\n","completion":" Ted: I know exactly what I say. (Ted comes out of the taxi) You chose the wrong guy. You chose the wrong guy. You did a very, very, very bad choice. What were you thinking? This guy? You kidding me? Have you learned anything these past 8 years? You'll be sorry. You know it? You'll be sorry, and you can do anything about it because it is too late. Anything you can do is start up your life miserable and disappointing that will never be as happy as it could be with me. Goodbye.\n"}
{"prompt":" Stella: Ted, wait.\n","completion":" Ted: Look, I'm not there to pick you. I am here because I need to know that you know you've made the worst mistake of your life.\n"}
{"prompt":" Stella: I know.\n","completion":" Ted: Okay. (Ted is still in the taxi) This is what I say.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!\n","completion":" Ted: What?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.\n","completion":" Ted: The good Backstreet Boys?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?!\n","completion":" Ted: What-what the hell happened to you?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Ah, let me see what I can do.\n","completion":" Ted: What? What can you do?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Lily is gonna kill me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this.\n","completion":" Ted: That's crazy. Of course she will.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Would you marry me?\n","completion":" Ted: No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule: never marry anyone you've had a farting contest with.\n"}
{"prompt":" In Marshall's room...\n","completion":" Ted: Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?!\n","completion":" Ted: What?!\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo.\n","completion":" Ted: Dude, those guys are criminals.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something!\n","completion":" Ted: Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted's in the wedding room...\n","completion":" Ted: Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?\n"}
{"prompt":" Ben: Yes.\n","completion":" Ted: Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ben: Yeah.\n","completion":" Ted: Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ben: Oh, no!\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area?\n"}
{"prompt":" Ben: Yeah, that would probably work, but with what? That's a tough one.\n","completion":" Ted: Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches\n"}
{"prompt":" Ben: Mm, yeah. Does anyone here wear a toupee? (Ben's wearing a toupee) Shouldn't be hard to find out. Most of them are pretty bad.\n","completion":" Ted: That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ben: Boy, that's a pretty tall order.\n","completion":" Ted: Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?\n"}
{"prompt":" Ben: No, not off the top of my... No. Can't.\n","completion":" Ted: Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Actually, I think it kinda works.\n","completion":" Ted: It totally does.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it?\n","completion":" Ted: It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Oh, you know...\n","completion":" Ted: In a bad way.\n"}
{"prompt":" Brad: Hey. Cool hair, bro.\n","completion":" Ted: What happened to your shirt?\n"}
{"prompt":" Brad: I got sauce on it when I tackled the caterer.\n","completion":" Ted: You gonna put another shirt on?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.\n","completion":" Ted: Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I wish we could have that wedding.\n","completion":" Ted: So do it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: What?\n","completion":" Ted: Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I don't have mine either.\n","completion":" Ted: You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick. You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called \"Eggs Marshall,\" and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy.\n","completion":" Ted: No problem.\n"}
{"prompt":" In the bathroom...\n","completion":" Ted: Please don't.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted from 2030: Kids, sometimes wonderful things come out of horrible situations. Like, remember that trip I took to Hong Kong where I got stuck in the airport? Well, a funny thing happened that day.\n","completion":" Ted: Yes, I realize it's raining, but, come on, it's 2021. We can make cell phones that project holograms, but a light drizzle shuts down a whole airport?\n"}
{"prompt":" Wendy: Hey, Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey... There she is. Wow.\n"}
{"prompt":" Wendy: Wendy the Waitress.\n","completion":" Ted: Wendy the Waitress! I was just saying-- what are you doing here?\n"}
{"prompt":" Woman: Oh, Ted, she doesn't want...\n","completion":" Ted: No, it's a cute story. Once upon a time...\n"}
{"prompt":" [FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: Zoey was married to this super rich, super creepy guy called The Captain. So when Zoey and I became friends, I was careful not to cross any lines.\n"}
{"prompt":" Zoey: Oh, man, this movie is scary.\n","completion":" Ted: I know, right? But then one day, Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight. He flipped out and demanded a divorce. And she was heartbroken. But after a little soul-searching, she ended up back in my and the rest, as they say, is history.\n"}
{"prompt":" Woman: Actually, I said, \"How's your meat?\"\n","completion":" Ted: Oh. A little cold.\n"}
{"prompt":" Zoey: Oh, Ted, did you have a chance to pick up that box I left at my old apartment?\n","completion":" Ted: Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain. I mean this in a super manly way. That guy scares the panties off me.\n"}
{"prompt":" Zoey: You don't have to see him. He left the box with the doorman.\n","completion":" Ted: If it's really important to you, I will pick it up tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big meaningless stack of paperwork that I have to get off my desk to make room for tomorrow's big meaningless stack of paperwork. But it's all worth it, you know, 'cause at least I know I'm making the world a... place. All right, see you guys later.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm worried about Marshall. He doesn't seem like himself lately.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds.\n","completion":" Ted: Anyway, we should get going.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted from 2030: A few days later, I headed over to The Captain's building to get Zoey's box.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm here to...\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: Ted. What a surprise. Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: Captain. I...\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain:You've come to rescue me from the capsized wreckage of my marriage. Mm... I hesitated calling you because I know you and Zoey were friendly.\n","completion":" Ted: Pssh, nah...\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is \"$12 million,\" and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance.\n","completion":" Ted: Guys, I got a problem. I ran into The Captain.\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain:Ted, beneath this lustrous mane,I wear the horns of a cuckold. Zoey left me for another man.\n","completion":" Ted: Wow.\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: Once upon a time, Zoey and I were happy. Blissful as Arcadian shepherds. I was Poseidon, she my Amphitrite. I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis could not have torn us asunder. We had great big boners for each other. But then... enter the scoundrel. I don't know what he looks like, but I picture him with a mustache.\n","completion":" Ted: Yes! Limit the search to guys with mustaches. Smart.\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: Anyway, soon the inevitable happened. She told me she was in love with someone else. Obviously, it made me angry.\n","completion":" Ted: And that's the last time you saw her.\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: But I gathered my composure, and told her I'd do anything to keep her. I begged her not to leave. We made love that night.\n","completion":" Ted: That's damn good brandy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: But morning came, and she was gone.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, Captain... don't blame yourself.\n"}
{"prompt":" [END OF FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: Me. I'm the bad guy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero.\n","completion":" Ted: Damn it! The box!\n"}
{"prompt":" The Captain's Building\n","completion":" Ted: Hi, I'm here to pick up...\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: Hello, Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: To the study?\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: To the study! Mmm. Ted... I know.\n","completion":" Ted: Know what?\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: I know who stole my Zoey. No man likes to be betrayed, especially by a friend. You can imagine then how painful it was when I learned that the name of my betrayer is... Ted... when I tell you who it is, you're gonna... It's my doorman!\n","completion":" Ted: That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: He always winks and tips his hat when he sees her. I know how these things work. He holds her package, and pretty soon, she's holding his. And then there's his glorious mustache. I will have him fired for this!\n","completion":" Ted: No, no, no, you can't fire him.\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: You're right. Maritime protocol demands physical retribution!\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop!\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: Who is this flower child, and what has he done with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?!\n","completion":" Ted: Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: Whoa, \"rapscallion\" may be going a bit far, Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that.\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: Why couldn't she just like boats? Just to have one thing in common? Other girls like boats, don't they?\n","completion":" Ted: Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey.\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: When you put it that way, I should almost thank the doorman.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, yeah! And, you know, since, since it doesn't really matter who Zoey's dating now...\n"}
{"prompt":" Captain: It doesn't, it really doesn't. It doesn't.\n","completion":" Ted: It's me. You're welcome.\n"}
{"prompt":" The Bar\n","completion":" Ted: Listen, Zoey, I need to ask you something. Did I steal you?\n"}
{"prompt":" Zoey: Well... yeah. You did. By being the kind of sweet, thoughtful guy who'd never even think of stealing someone, you stole me.\n","completion":" Ted: So I'm the bad guy. Great.\n"}
{"prompt":" Zoey: Well, the story isn't over, Ted. It'll be years before we know who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. I mean, yes, divorce sucks, but sometimes things need to fall apart to make way for better things.\n","completion":" Ted: If you say so.\n"}
{"prompt":" Wendy: And three kids later, we decided to come here on our second honeymoon.\n","completion":" Ted: Wow. That's a pretty good omelet.\n"}
{"prompt":" Wendy: Oh, and hey, what about you? You still with Zoey?\n","completion":" Ted: No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well. But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids. It's actually a funny story of how we met. I was a best man at this wedding...\n"}
{"prompt":" Wendy: Listen, Ted, it's great seeing you, but we got to run.\n","completion":" Ted: Okay, well, have a safe trip. It was great seeing you. (Ted phones Marshall) Hello. Marshall.\n"}

{"prompt":" Marshall: Ted, you had to bring a cheesecake, but you've brought two shopping bags and a girl who knows not. My name is Marshall. Welcome. Ted talks.\n","completion":" Ted: Amanda will make a cake for Lily. She is head. We met at the restaurant last week when I returned my soup. Fortunately, she has such beautiful hair it not bother me a bit to eat.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Thank you. You wrote all that you love our queen of the day. And Lilypad, you must guess who wrote what. \"From his friends to his students, Lily that everyone in his life...\"\n","completion":" Ted: Lily is a teacher. Hence the \"students\".\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: \"... feel loved. She makes the best cookies oatmeal raisin-, The Goonies knows by heart... \"\n","completion":" Ted: Lily saw The Goonies just after his parents separated. After that, she had real problems of trust.\n"}
{"prompt":" They gather by the fireplace.\n","completion":" Ted: Wait, I'll find Amanda.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: No problem, it is occupied. The bother, come on.\n","completion":" Ted: Wait... You do not want Amanda on the picture, right?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Well, you know, auto focus, speed of obstruction, zoom...\n","completion":" Ted: Lily, what's the matter?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Who wants a party hat? I'm a bird! All do the bird!\n","completion":" Ted: Tell me the truth.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Of course not. I let another of your bitches spoil my memories.\n","completion":" Ted: Lily, what are you talking?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Ted, you always do that. You bring a girl knows that not all our evenings with us.\n","completion":" Ted: That's not true.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Christmas morning, there was 4. Our first Christmas together, just us five. Here's another nice little game. It's called, Appoints This Bitch.\n","completion":" Ted: That's Pap Pa......\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Funny. Every year my mother took tea with her friend Easter Bell. Not so funny.\n","completion":" Ted: I remember, this is Sarah.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: And me too. He has how many hands?\n","completion":" Ted: Normal if it is good guitarist.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: It's physically impossible for me to take a picture ugly. I know why. Ask God.\n","completion":" Ted: Lily, sorry for Amanda. But I'll say. You make your spoiled rotten. You in all your statements because you think I messed up two three photos?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall, Ted and Karen are in an airplane.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm so excited you're here.\n"}
{"prompt":" Karen: Wait, I must tell you something.\n","completion":" Ted: Really? Because I think I want to tell you the same thing.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: The camera loves me. Much more than that. The device I want. The unit wants to put on underwear, put an Al Green CD, dim the lights and do all the work while I was still lying with closed eyes.\n","completion":" Ted: I feel sorry for Paris and group photos ruined, but... when you're single, you must hope that every girl is good. I mean, Erin.Irene.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Emily. Isabelle.\n","completion":" Ted: And Sarah.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Leilani! What's your problem?\n","completion":" Ted: At the time, I thought each of these girls could be good, but I have to keep hoping. I have no choice.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: You should listen to Robin.\n","completion":" Ted: Because Robin is your best friend.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Right.\n","completion":" Ted: Your best friend on Earth.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Attention Lily. It's a trap.\n","completion":" Ted: Before being your best friend, what was she? That's it. One of my random sluts.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: It puts an end to all this conversation about the bitches.Back to the birthday song! Barney, your part is this: \"She's cute She's cute.\"\n","completion":" Ted: I bring these girls to party because you are important. You are my family.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Like the time we celebrated the success of Marshall to the bar.\n","completion":" Ted: Here's the disgusting smelly hippie with whom I go out.\n"}
{"prompt":" End flashback\n","completion":" Ted: I did not say that!\n"}
{"prompt":" Flashback\n","completion":" Ted: Here's Framboise.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: You must order more food?\n","completion":" Ted: No. Raspberry does not eat.\n"}
{"prompt":" End flashback\n","completion":" Ted: I confess. Raspberry was a mistake. But how would I know?\n"}
{"prompt":" All: It was called Raspberry!\n","completion":" Ted: If this is so important, Amanda is not in the picture. It does not spoil your birthday. Give him a chance.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted returns to the apartment Marshall and Lily.\n","completion":" Ted: Amanda refuses to return. She thinks you hate it. Marshall, you have to go apologize.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: You've ruined Lily's birthday and you want me to apologize? At worst, you should apologize.\n","completion":" Ted: What are you talking?\n"}
{"prompt":" End flashback\n","completion":" Ted: Sorry that my search for love has you so upset. You know, your precious photos might be better if I was not over.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Cheap Shot. Low blow.\n","completion":" Ted: You know what these pictures? A big lie. We ask. They are retouched. They are what you want but not the reality.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: This is not true!\n","completion":" Ted: Oh? Look at that one. Halloween, there is 2 years old. You had not played because you wanted to disguise yourself as a penguin.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: It's not that she would not, but she said that penguins are zero. Penguins.\n","completion":" Ted: And yet you're there, smiling as if nothing was wrong, completely wrong. Robin's birthday, there is 3 years old. Robin had a cold, and you made him remove his pajamas for the photo.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: It's true.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, that was good.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: It's true.\n","completion":" Ted: Do you remember what happened?\n"}
{"prompt":" Man: Well, are you ready?\n","completion":" Ted: Wait, we take what poses? The two cops friends?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Yeah. Just one second per cons. We are writing history. We'll take our first picture of roommate.\n","completion":" Ted: And if you came to ask us?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Really?\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: What are you doing, Ted? And if one breaks?\n","completion":" Ted: And if you break it?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I had totally forgotten that. Marshall and I were together for only a few weeks and you invited me in the photo.\n","completion":" Ted: I liked you.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: We must bring back Amanda.\n","completion":" Ted: Really?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: You believed in me. It's my turn to believe in you. As far as I know, this is good.\n","completion":" Ted: Thank you, Lil.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Come on everybody, come here. Let's make a memory.\n","completion":" Ted: Marshall, try this. Keep your eyes closed until the last second and when I say, open them.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: What? Where?\n","completion":" Ted: Now, Marshall!\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Names that bitch.\n","completion":" Ted: Ann has...? Anna?\n"}
{"prompt":" ('Two Months and 26 Days Later,' Ted sitting on couch talking on phone)\n","completion":" Ted: Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date.\n","completion":" Ted: Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Ted, it's a simile.\n","completion":" Ted: Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date, a $200 piece of chicken-slash-salmon will go uneaten. I gotta bring someone, but who?\n"}
{"prompt":" (Robin gets up and walks over to bar)\n","completion":" Ted: OK, guys, I gotta say something. I think my feelings for Robin may be resurfacing.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Not again. Come on, dude, we all know how this movie ends. Ted falls in love. Love kicks Ted in the sprouts. Roll credits.\n","completion":" Ted: No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture. Fact.\n"}

{"prompt":" (flashback to Ted and Robin kissing on roof)\n","completion":" Ted: Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof. Fact.\n"}
{"prompt":" (flashback to Ted and Robin kissing at New Year's)\n","completion":" Ted: On New Year's Eve, we kissed again. Fact.\n"}
{"prompt":" (back to present scene)\n","completion":" Ted: I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted and Robin talking over by bar)\n","completion":" Ted: You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship is to celebrate someone else's successful one.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Well, makes sense.\n","completion":" Ted: So, with that mind, our friends Claudia and Stuart are having this crazy, black-tie wedding on Saturday. You wanna be my 'plus one'?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Your date? I'd love to. Um, how fancy are we talking about here?\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, you're gonna wanna bring your A game.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Bye babe.\n","completion":" Ted: Whoa, did you see how fired up she was? I don't know, there's something there. And come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne. Who knows? Barney: Wow, Ted, you're gonna have to find another gender for yourself 'cause I'm revoking your dude membership.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted: Whoa, did you see how fired up she was? I don't know, there's something there. And come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne. Who knows? Barney: Wow, Ted, you're gonna have to find another gender for yourself 'cause I'm revoking your dude membership.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday?\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted sees Claudia talking on phone)\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, Claudia!\n"}
{"prompt":" (Claudia hangs)\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, how's it going? Claudia: My wedding's in two days, that's how it's going.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted: Hey, how's it going? Claudia: My wedding's in two days, that's how it's going.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, don't worry, it's gonna be great. I'm so excited.\n"}
{"prompt":" Claudia: You should be, lots of single girls.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, well, yeah, I'm bringing a date, so I'll be off the market.\n"}
{"prompt":" Claudia: You're not bringing a date.\n","completion":" Ted: Uh, yes I am.\n"}
{"prompt":" Claudia: Uh, no you're not.\n","completion":" Ted: I checked 'plus one'.\n"}
{"prompt":" Claudia: No you didn't.\n","completion":" Ted: Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked...\n"}
{"prompt":" Claudia: Ted, you did not check 'plus one', you are not bringing a date to my wedding.\n","completion":" Ted: But I already invited someone.\n"}
{"prompt":" Claudia: You are not bringing a guest, Ted. The guest list has been closed for months. Months!\n","completion":" Ted: But I checked 'plus one'. I always check 'plus one'.\n"}
{"prompt":" Claudia: You absolutely did not check 'plus one'. If you had checked 'plus one', I would have called you to get the name of your guest so I could get the guest cards printed up. Did I call you to get the name of your guest? Is there a place card with her name card printed on it?\n","completion":" Ted: She doesn't need a place card, she knows her name.\n"}
{"prompt":" Claudia: What's she eating? You ordered the chicken, what did she order? Do you see how your story is full of holes?\n","completion":" Ted: Come on, Claudia, we go way back. Isn't there room for just one more person?\n"}
{"prompt":" (Marshall, Barney and Ted sit at booth)\n","completion":" Ted: I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: But to be fair, she's also hot.\n","completion":" Ted: I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Yeah, right.\n","completion":" Ted: I did.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?\n","completion":" Ted: Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Wow.\n","completion":" Ted: Please stop. I gotta call Claudia. If I just explain to her...\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Ted, no. Let it go. She's about to get married. She's got enough to worry about.\n","completion":" Ted: Then what am I gonna do?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Hey.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, listen.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Wait, two things. First of all, I've been laying groundwork all afternoon, totally subtle, totally cool, not pushing, not even nudging. Just the theme of today is Ted rocks. And she's picking up on it lying down.\n","completion":" Ted: Lily's there's a problem.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I think I brought it.\n","completion":" Ted: Wow.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: That's what I was going for. I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're gonna have so much fun.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, about that.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: So, the dress?\n","completion":" Ted: I don't have a 'plus one' for the wedding.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: What?\n","completion":" Ted: I ran into Claudia and she told me I didn't check 'plus one' on the reply card.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Why didn't you check 'plus...\n","completion":" Ted: I did check 'plus one'.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: But Robin is so excited.\n","completion":" Ted: I know.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: And the dress.\n","completion":" Ted: I know.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Oh. OK, OK, we'll, we'll sneak her in.\n","completion":" Ted: We can't sneak her in, we're not ninjas.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I wish we were ninjas.\n","completion":" Ted: I know.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: You can always ask Stuart.\n","completion":" Ted: Can I do that?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Sure, you guys have been friends for a long time, and it's 40% his wedding too.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, it's gonna be a tough sell.\n"}
{"prompt":" Stuart: Dude, no problem whatsoever.\n","completion":" Ted: Really? Stuart: Sure, the more the merrier.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted: Really? Stuart: Sure, the more the merrier.\n","completion":" Ted: Wow, wow, thanks for being so cool about this 'cause you know Claudia said...\n"}
{"prompt":" (Stuart opens front door)\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, she's not usually like that.\n"}
{"prompt":" Stuart: No.\n","completion":" Ted: Well, thanks, Stu, it's gonna be a great wedding.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted enters front door)\n","completion":" Ted: I did it. I did it. I'm taking her to the wedding.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: What? How?\n","completion":" Ted: I talked to Stuart.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Cell phone rings, Ted takes his cell phone out of his pocket)\n","completion":" Ted: It's Claudia.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: So, it begins.\n","completion":" Ted: Come on, it can't be that bad.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted looks at phone)\n","completion":" Ted: Here, Lily, you answer it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: What? Why?\n","completion":" Ted: Because this whole thing was your idea. And Claudia scares me.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Marshall slaps Ted)\n","completion":" Ted: Ow!\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: (to Claudia on phone) Uh-huh, uh-huh.\n","completion":" Ted: It's not because of me, is it?\n"}
{"prompt":" (another cell phone rings, Lily passes phone to Ted)\n","completion":" Ted: It's Robin.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Answer it.\n","completion":" Ted: Uh, Lily's phone.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Ted. Where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought.\n","completion":" Ted: Uh, Lily's busy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Oh, OK, well I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's gonna love them.\n","completion":" Ted: That's great. I'll tell Lily to tell me. Uh, listen, I really wanna keep talking but now's not a good time so, um, I'm really excited about tomorrow. OK, bye.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted and Robin hang up)\n","completion":" Ted: Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this. Do you think she's into me?\n"}
{"prompt":" (Lily and Claudia hang up phones)\n","completion":" Ted: I feel terrible.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Well, feel terrible later. Right now, we gotta fix this. Lily, you go down to the bar and comfort Claudia. Ted and I will go and try to talk some sense into Stuart.\n","completion":" Ted: Tell Claudia I'm sorry. Did she seem pissed at me?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000.\n","completion":" Ted: Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted and Marshall talk to Stuart as he packs books into boxes)\n","completion":" Ted: Stuart, I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...\n"}
{"prompt":" Stuart: You know, I'll see some super-hot model chick and I'll think, \"why am I with Claudia? I can be with her.\"\n","completion":" Ted: That's crazy. I mean, you're the luckiest...you and Claudia both...\n"}
{"prompt":" Stuart: The point is, I wanna get married, I wanna settle down. But right now, that's just not who I am. I'm not a commitment guy, I'm a single guy.\n","completion":" Ted: Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other. Everybody feels this way sometimes.\n"}
{"prompt":" Stuart: How would you know, you're not even married?\n","completion":" Ted: OK, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily. He's the pro. This guy knows relationships. Tell him, Marshall.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Stuart, don't get married.\n","completion":" Ted: Dude.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I'm sorry. Being in a couple is hard and committing, making sacrifices, it's hard. But if it's the right person, then it's easy. Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life, that should be the easiest thing in the world. And if it's not like that, then she's not the one. I'm sorry.\n","completion":" Ted: You know I don't have $400,000, right?\n"}
{"prompt":" (Stuart and Claudia kiss)\n","completion":" Ted: So, where did we land on the whole 'plus one' thing?\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted walks up to Robin's front door in tuxedo, knocks on door, Robin opens door)\n","completion":" Ted: Still wow.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted walks into Robin's apartment)\n","completion":" Ted: Oh yeah, I thought about leaving it at home, but I figured I don't wanna get there and realize I need it and have to go all the way back to get it, so, yeah, I brought it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Really? Like, anchor anchor? What happened to Sandy? OK, OK, sure, what time do you need me to...Right now! Oh.\n","completion":" Ted: Do it. Do it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen.\n","completion":" Ted: What's a sixteen?\n"}
{"prompt":" Claudia: Hi Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: Claudia.\n"}
{"prompt":" Stuart: Yeah, where is she?\n","completion":" Ted: Um (clears throat) She couldn't make it.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Claudia laughs)\n","completion":" Ted: What's so funny? Claudia: Plan a wedding, you'll see.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Stuart and Claudia walk away)\n","completion":" Ted: Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Claudia hands Ted his reply card, Ted takes it and looks at it, Claudia walks away)\n","completion":" Ted: I didn't check 'plus one'. You were right. Barney: Of course I was right.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted: I didn't check 'plus one'. You were right. Barney: Of course I was right.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Being single's the best.\n","completion":" Ted: Stay out as late as you want.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Answer to no one.\n","completion":" Ted: The whole world full of endless possibilities.\n"}
{"prompt":" TV anchor: \"Welcome back to Superbowl XLIV in Miami. Get a load of that guy! You think that's his real number?\"\n","completion":" Ted: Well, that explains where Barney is.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Hey, guys!\n","completion":" Ted: Hey!\n"}
{"prompt":" Ranjit: Hello.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, Ranjit!\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: OK I've enlisted Ranjit's services as my personal driver because for the next week I'll be sleeping with hundreds of women and I don't want to take the subway cause... you know... germs!\n","completion":" Ted: Wait, you're... you're actually gonna hook up with these girls that call you?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Oh, indubitably! I'm meeting the first one here any minute. Keep your eyes pealed for a red sweater. Based on her texts, she's dirty, dyslexic and want to 96 me, semi-colon and parenthesis.\n","completion":" Ted: This ought to be good. I can only imagine the quality of girls...\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: How's it going?\n","completion":" Ted: That beer looks a little flat.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Nuh, it's scotch.\n","completion":" Ted: Something troubling you, kiddo?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: He asked me out.\n","completion":" Ted: That's crazy! And they use \"Ulee\" because of the vowels.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: What would your viewers think?\n","completion":" Ted: Wow wow wow, you said you'd go out with him on Valentine's? I thought we had plans!\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Getting drunk and cleaning the apartment was a plan?\n","completion":" Ted: I did NOT...say... it was a good plan.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Guys, guys, guys, we're on me now. And it is getting in-teh-resting. Looks at these texts. Read this one. Yowza! Now look at this one. Does she text her mother with those fingers? Now look at this one... or this one, or this one, or this one, or...\n","completion":" Ted: OK OK OK buddy, how about you do this? Go nail that girl, then read your texts.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: I know, isn't it wonderful? (answers phone) Go for Barney. Cut to the chase, what's your cup size?...Oh, hi Mom!\n","completion":" Ted: So there's a hotter girl. Isn't that the problem in a nutshell? There's too many options. You got internet dating, you got bars...\n"}
{"prompt":" Ranjit: I never had that problem. When I was 18, I had an arranged marriage. And I love my wife more and more every day.\n","completion":" Ted: Hm.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Err, of course he asked me out.\n","completion":" Ted: Err no he didn't.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Whaaat?!! (in a high voice) (huffs) Nooo, I HATE Don! I-I-I can't stop thinking how much I hate him, it's like, it's like... all the time. I just wanna attack him and rip his stupid clothes off and spank him with his little paddle until his bum's all red. SHUT UP!! (leaves the table)\n","completion":" Ted: See! That right there is what free will gets you. Constant ego-shattering uncertainty. I'm done with that. I want what Ranjit has. I've spent my entire adult life looking for the perfect woman and I'm spending Valentine's Day scrubbing the toilet. I need someone else to find me that woman. Marshall, Lily, arrange-marriage me!\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: You want us to arrange your marriage?\n","completion":" Ted: Absolutely. Looks there's two sides to dating, right? Picking and getting picked. Getting picked, I'm good at. Ladies looove Teddy Westside.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: You're waiting for me to comment on your self-assigned nickname? Well, here's my comment. I love it.\n","completion":" Ted: Really?! (excited)\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Teddy Westside? Continue.\n","completion":" Ted: It's the picking, I suck at. I pick the wrong girls. But you guys, you're the best pickers I know. You picked each other.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: And a healthy splash of Drakkar Noir. (they hive five) (Robin giggles)\n","completion":" Ted: Get out there and find me a girl. We'll double date on Valentine's Day. If I like her, I will marry her... if she's cool with it. And she will be. Cause I'll wear my nice blazer.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Robin, neurologically speaking, the part of the human brain that makes you hate people is located right next to the part of the brain that makes you want to jump people's bones. The two responses are so similar, it's hard to tell them apart.\n","completion":" Ted: You know what it's like? Wait, I have to get a book. Give me 30 seconds.\n"}
{"prompt":" (22 minutes later)\n","completion":" Ted: OK this is fun. Look at this picture. It's a rabbit! You can look at it for hours and be absolutely sure it's a rabbit. But then one day, you look at it and you realize, \"wait a second, it's a duck!\" Rabbit, duck, rabbit, duck. Isn't it fun?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Relationships are like that. I mean, look, when you first met Don, you hated him, you thought \"This guy's a duck\", but one of these days you're gonna realize \"This is actually someone that I love, he's a rabbit\".\n","completion":" Ted: Wow I think you got it backwards there, buddy. The duck is the thing you love, the rabbit is the thing you hate.\n"}
{"prompt":" (flash forward)\n","completion":" Ted: Duck is delicious. Rabbit is all gamey.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: (yelling) We're not talking about flavour, Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: (yelling as well) Flavour counts.\n"}
{"prompt":" (flash forward)\n","completion":" Ted: Hold on, I've got to get another book.\n"}
{"prompt":" (flash forward)\n","completion":" Ted: Then why don't we take, a rabbit, a duck, stick 'em in a cardboard box and let them fight it out?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Because it's illegal, Ted!\n","completion":" Ted: Only if we bet on it, Marshall!\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Say it.\n","completion":" Ted: You have to say it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: YAY.\n","completion":" Ted: YESSS.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Thank you. And Don is, and always will be, a rabbit.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh I wouldn't be so sure about that, Robin. Think about it. Don... Donald. Donald... Duck. (Marshall sighs heavily) And what, I wonder, does Donald Duck never wear?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Pants.\n","completion":" Ted: Pants. Don's... a duck. (Lily and Marshall sigh in awe of Ted) Permission to say \"lawyered\"?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I'll allow it.\n","completion":" Ted: Lawyered.\n"}

{"prompt":" Marshall: You should put yourself on track.\n","completion":" Ted: I understand how you feel. It is important friendship. In this regard, Emerson wrote a great poem, titled Friendship. You'll love it. \"A drop of crimson blood carries more weight than the waves of the sea...\"\n"}
{"prompt":" Flashback\n","completion":" Ted: You must try this Syrah. A taste of creme de cassis, red berries, oak heated...

Which is higher than a bass-baritone.There is a key moment in the second act of La Boheme...\n"}
{"prompt":" End flashback\n","completion":" Ted: I try to add some class to our meetings. It's like this quote from Dante's Inferno. \"Consider the race of which you are created not to live like brutes but to follow virtue and knowledge.\"Or, in Italian original...\n"}

{"prompt":" Marshall: Ted! It was our first post! It is popular. It was... a golf magazine for... Marissa Heller. A catalog of wicker furniture, also Marissa Heller.

I wonder how it looks.\n"}
{"prompt":" End flashback\n","completion":" Ted: And since, in every mail we receive, the picture becomes clearer. But we know not how it looks. I will follow it as always...\n"}

{"prompt":" Lily: Damn it then!\n","completion":" Ted: That's Marissa Heller. She is pretty.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney Stinson, outside. It will not.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm on it. This lift uses the same mechanism from its installation in 1906. It seems that Lamar Louis Skolnick, the architect of the building, has cut the panels himself.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marissa: A fan of Skolnick? I love the juxtaposition between the German Renaissance outside...\n","completion":" Ted: And some French influence inside! He was an architect with a poet's soul, really.\n"}

You know, I always say they use \"Ulee\" of Gold Life for vowels? Tell them.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Can I talk for a second?\n","completion":" Ted: Ten letters, a diminutive egg pie?\n"}
{"prompt":" Will: Mini quiche? Where?\n","completion":" Ted: There. A great reception.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marissa: Ted. There you are. We will soon make blind-tests of white wine. It will surely be great.\n","completion":" Ted: I missed that glitch. I know, do not bother to say. There's no glitch in the wine.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Sorry!\n","completion":" Ted: Look, I'm having fun here, so I'll pass Robots vs. Wrestlers.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: But you never missed Robots vs. Wrestlers. It happens that way. First Robin us loose, and now you? And for those pretentious snobs and old game?\n","completion":" Ted: Actually, I like those pretentious snobs and they are not old fashioned fart noise when I open my mouth. I remain. See you tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: It means everything. If you come not to Robots vs. Wrestlers, it's the end of our friendship.\n","completion":" Ted: See you tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt":" Man: Where did your buddies?\n","completion":" Ted: You know, a reading of poetry.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted is blindfolded, a glass in hand.\n","completion":" Ted: Citrus and honeycomb with a sharp acidity. This is a Sauvignon Blanc, Loire Valley. The town of Sancerre.\n"}
{"prompt":" Will: Ted, you are a remarkable lyric baritone.\n","completion":" Ted: Thank you, Will Shortz.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I can not believe!\n","completion":" Ted: Of course, hell is an interesting concept, is not it? I always liked to imagine it as Dante's Divine Comedy. If I may. Italian original... (Thinking...) I do not believe it. I recite the Divine Comedy in Italian original, and nobody makes fart noises. It's weird. I've never gone that far. I just seem to be an asshole. My God, I control myself! Listen to me, I am completely let go! I'm the biggest asshole on the planet. I wish someone stops me.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted wrestler: Soy el conquistador de las maquinas!\n","completion":" Ted: I gotta run.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Look who thinks he can come here and repeat the group. Well, you can forget. Pity, remake the group! I want to lose anyone yet! We're sorry. You can recite all the poems of asshole that you want, we never say anything bad on it, I promise.\n","completion":" Ted: Really? Because there is a poem I would recite... Friendship of Ralph Waldo Emerson. \"A drop of crimson blood carries more weight than the waves of the sea The world uncertain comes and goes...\"\n"}

{"prompt":" Ted: It was carved in strategic places.\n","completion":" Ted: So, uh, we're at the bar and I see her mix kahlua...\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: A cocktail she invented herself.\n","completion":" Ted: And she...\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily, Marshall, Barney: Because it tastes like an alcoholic Tootsie Roll.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, can I please tell this story? So we had this instant connection. She gave me her number, but then something...\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall, Lily, Barney: Something went terribly wrong.\n","completion":" Ted: Guys! Something went terribly wrong.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted walks in through front door)\n","completion":" Ted: Sonny, where's Cher?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Right here, babe.\n","completion":" Ted: I just met the perfect woman. She's funny. She's beautiful. She loves Star Wars.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. What's her take on Ewoks?\n","completion":" Ted: Loves them.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Oh good. I don't know why people are so cynical about Ewoks. The Rebellion would have failed without the Ewoks.\n","completion":" Ted: Get this, she's a marine biologist. She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Oh, penguins are cool, kinda like black and white Ewoks. I approve.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, where's my, uh, Kit Kat? I put it right here on this table.\n"}

{"prompt":" (Ted grabs kid's candy and dumps it on the floor)\n","completion":" Ted: Where's the Kit Kat? Where's the Kit Kat!\n"}
{"prompt":" BAR\n","completion":" Ted: Never found her number, never saw her again. But every year they have a Halloween party up on the roof so that's where I'll be.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: You know, Ted, it's been four years. She could be engaged or married or, God forbid, fat.\n","completion":" Ted: I don't know, I got a feeling. This could be the year. Halloween is a night of wonder and magic.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Lily, Marshall, and Barney groan)\n","completion":" Ted: OK, bring the mockery. Fine, I can take it. Come on, wouldn't it be the coolest story ever if the Slutty Pumpkin turned out to be my future wife?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily (from bedroom): Ted, is your world ready to be rocked? (echo) rocked-rocked-rocked.\n","completion":" Ted: Can't wait.\n"}

Trust me, by the end of the night, your chad will not be hanging.\n","completion":" Ted: We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year. Tonight, I'm going up to the roof, I'm gonna have a few beers, I'm gonna wait for the Slutty Pumpkin. That's just what I do.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Hm, (putting up left hand) Victoria's Secret models prancing around in bras and panties, or (putting up right hand) Yale preppies reuniting their stupid a capella group. What's that left hand? Right hand sucks? Word.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm heading up to the roof.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Hey, Chad, how's it hanging?\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, word play. Funny.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: I can't believe you talked me into this.\n","completion":" Ted: I didn't. You followed me up here.\n"}

{"prompt":" Robin: I played tennis in high school. You know why? Because it was just me out there. I couldn't even stand playing doubles. I just got dumped.\n","completion":" Ted: Man, that sucks.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Yeah, it's OK. I wasn't that into him. Story of my life. Everyone else is all falling in love and acting stupid and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me. Why don't I want that more? I want to want that. Am I wired wrong or something?\n","completion":" Ted: No. Look, you didn't want to be with me so clearly you have abysmal taste in men.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Robin laughs)\n","completion":" Ted: But you're wired just fine.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Well, what if I'm just a cold person? Tonight, Mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but I couldn't be Gretel. Why can't I be Gretel?\n","completion":" Ted: Because you just haven't met the right Hansel yet. One day you're gonna meet a guy who's gonna make you want to look like a complete idiot.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Really?\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, he's out there somewhere, just like the Slutty Pumpkin. (echoes) pumpkin-pumpkin...\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: How do you do this, Ted? How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up.\n","completion":" Ted: Well, I'm pretty drunk.

{"prompt":" [FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep. Anyway, I got the care package, and it's just great. Here, listen... Mmm. Mmm!\n"}
{"prompt":" [END OF FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake... And... I said something dumb.\n"}
{"prompt":" [FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail. I sent it a couple days ago. And it's awesome. Really, really awesome.\n"}
{"prompt":" [END OF FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: Why did I say that? I think frosting makes me lie.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Oh, Teddy boy.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her. So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: All right, here's what you do: Put together a care package of stuff from New York-- some H&H bagels, an Empire State Building keychain... and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready? From three days ago.\n","completion":" Ted: That's brilliant. You're brilliant. You know, it's funny, not so long ago, I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you.\n"}
{"prompt":" [END OF FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: So, did she get the awesome care package yet?\n","completion":" Ted: Yep. Yesterday.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Did she love it?\n","completion":" Ted: Ooh, she loved it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: So what's the problem?\n","completion":" Ted: So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you, we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half. Eventually you just run out of stuff to say.\n"}
{"prompt":" [FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: What did you have for lunch today? Oh. Rye bread. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Oh, Teddy boy.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch. Maybe it just can't be do. I think it's clear what I have to do.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: It's pretty clear.\n","completion":" Ted: I have to go to Germany and surprise her.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted from 2030: The next moning, I was about to buy my ticket to Germany when I got an e-mail.\n","completion":" Ted: Uh-oh.\n"}
{"prompt":" Victoria's voice: \"Hey, Ted, sorry I missed your call last night. This long-distance thing sucks, huh? Listen, I've been thinking and I really need to talk to you tonight. I'll call you at 11:00. Victoria.\" So?\n","completion":" Ted: So she's going to dump me. Has anyone ever said, \"Listen, I've been thinking,\" and then follow it up with something good? It's not like: Listen, I've been thinking, Nutter-Butters are an underrated cookie. What else can it be? What could she possibly have to say to me that she couldn't write in an e-mail?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I cut off all my fingers? Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it. I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident. I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you.\n","completion":" Ted: Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy. So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.\n","completion":" Ted: No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome.\n","completion":" Ted: Thanks. Anyway, it's almost 11:00. I should let you go. Break a leg.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted from 2030: And so I was sitting at home, waiting for the phone to ring, something occurred to me.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney, singing: *He's giving you the blues. You want to graduate, but not in his bed. Here's what you got to do Pick up the phone...*\n","completion":" Ted: Marshall.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Hey, hey.\n","completion":" Ted: Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you in a month.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Yeah. Yeah. How you doing?\n","completion":" Ted: I think Victoria's about to break up with me.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Oh, God, I'm sorry, man.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like. The more I try to picture her, the more I can't. Like, I remember how she makes me feel. I just... I don't completely remember her. It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Preserving something that's already gone. Sounds like environmental law.\n","completion":" Ted: I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car?\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted from 2030: It turns out some things are worth preserving. But here's the real question: It's 2:00 a.m. Your friends are still out singing karaoke, but you're home early 'cause you're expecting a call from your girlfriend in Germany, who was supposed to call four hours ago. And then the phone rings.\n","completion":" Ted: Hello.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: MAQACENJaR?\n","completion":" Ted: Wait, I can find. With Mothers Who I'd like Sunset And Never Forgot.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I do not see how it could not walk.\n","completion":" Ted: What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: My book? Buddy... in two volumes, right here.\n","completion":" Ted: A great book.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: So, I have told you, I take a break on that side.\n","completion":" Ted: It's going to happen.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: What?\n","completion":" Ted: You'll fall in love.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: It's unlikely, I focus on my career, finished the rencards.\n","completion":" Ted: We play Pyramid. What people are saying just before meeting the love.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: It's good but...\n","completion":" Ted: Travis Frenchroy, replacing bartender told me... \"I'm done with all these rencards. I want to concentrate on my fan fiction of Star Trek. \"Six months later... Married!\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Matthew Blitz, accounting job, said... \"I will die alone.To focus as much on taxes this year. \"Six months later? PACS and plans to marry pending the enactment of the Act currently in the Senate from New York!\n","completion":" Ted: It happens, whatever you say. It is a law of nature.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Judged. By nature.\n","completion":" Ted: Trust me. I would not get interested in relationships. I would not be single if I wanted to be single.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Okay. Are you ready?\n","completion":" Ted: Ready for what?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Three years ago, Shelly started working at my school.When I saw her, I said, \"It's perfect for Ted.\"\n","completion":" Ted: Why do not you talk to me now?\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted, with chicken fingers in the mouth: This girl is super nice with Lily!\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah she was pretty.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I will fix it but promise me not to do anything stupid.\n","completion":" Ted: I promise to do anything stupid.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Do you believe? He says it's my fault. And by the way, Ted, I bet she go out with you again.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm thinking. Do I want to date a girl that Barney was typed?Help me for harmonies. Of course.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I'll fetch the newspaper.\n","completion":" Ted: Or rather, look for a husband.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: You must stop, seriously. The last thing I'm looking for now is a relationship.\n","completion":" Ted: Taking the newspaper, think to watch the ads for marriages.For yours.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Sorry to interrupt but check it out.\n","completion":" Ted: No.\n"}
{"prompt":" End flashback\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, my god, it's horrible. I wonder if it works.\n"}
{"prompt":" Woman: And what happens after it?\n","completion":" Ted: He starts singing and objects come alive and dance with him.\n"}
{"prompt":" A knock on the door. Ted will open. Barney comes into diving suit.\n","completion":" Ted: Apparently, it will rain.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: She is getting married.\n","completion":" Ted: I will prepare my toast.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: It's a good guy.\n","completion":" Ted: Come on, go out with him.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: It says what?\n","completion":" Ted: It's The Diver.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I will not fall in love with him.\n","completion":" Ted: Yes, because it is... this kind.\n"}
{"prompt":" Waitress: And for the birthday boy, lasagna.\n","completion":" Ted: Thank you.\n"}
{"prompt":" Waitress: Careful. The plate is very hot.\n","completion":" Ted: 'Kay. Oh, go on, touch it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Ah! Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.\n","completion":" Ted: All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy.\n","completion":" Ted: Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time. Barney.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Ah... Happy birthday, Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: Whoo-hoo!\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.\n","completion":" Ted: Wait for it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Still, you know, another year older. Still single. You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking?\n","completion":" Ted: Nope. I hit the snooze button.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun. It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys. Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good.\n","completion":" Ted: I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Well, what's perfect?\n","completion":" Ted: It's not like I have a list.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Oh, yes, you do.\n","completion":" Ted: Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: That's not hard. I know at least...\n","completion":" Ted: I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.\n","completion":" Ted: Any Kim from any cool band, really. Can't be too picky.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: You're never going to find this girl.\n","completion":" Ted: Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me. I am done trying to plan the unplannable.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?\n","completion":" Ted: That's the plan.\n"}
{"prompt":" At the appartment\n","completion":" Ted: Whoa, you're up early.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.\n","completion":" Ted: Does Marshall know?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Awesome. So awesome. God! Best girl ever. Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.\n","completion":" Ted: Please don't do that. Hey, is this milk any good?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.\n","completion":" Ted: God, why didn't you throw it away?\n"}
{"prompt":" At the appartment\n","completion":" Ted: Hello?\n"}
{"prompt":" Man: Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?\n","completion":" Ted: Speaking.\n"}
{"prompt":" Man: Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir? Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions. You signed up for our services about six months ago.\n","completion":" Ted: Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.\n"}
{"prompt":" At Love Solutions\n","completion":" Ted: I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?\n"}
{"prompt":" Bob: Well, my firm bought out the company. You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate, but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so... here I am.\n","completion":" Ted: So I'm in good hands. You found me a match?\n"}
{"prompt":" Bob: There she is. Your soul mate. That'll be 500 bucks.\n","completion":" Ted: No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted from 2030: So I read the file. And by God, this woman was perfect. She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina, she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword, she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna, her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl.\n","completion":" Ted: All right, fine. Set it up.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted's phone starts ringing, he picks up)\n","completion":" Ted: Lily?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Hey, Ted, are you busy?\n","completion":" Ted: Um... yes.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot. Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?\n","completion":" Ted: What? What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Marshall can't know about this. Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story. Can you please hurry?\n","completion":" Ted: I can't, I'm waiting...\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand? No, drifter, no!\n","completion":" Ted: Come on, Lily.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: But you see my point.\n","completion":" Ted: All right, stay there. I'm on my way.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date?\n","completion":" Ted: Yes.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: And was she okay about pushing it back?\n","completion":" Ted: Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: You can never tell Marshall.\n","completion":" Ted: I won't.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.\n","completion":" Ted: I swear on Luke and Leia.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: About a month ago, I started getting insomnia. Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time. But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.\n","completion":" Ted: Did you talk to Marshall about it?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...\n","completion":" Ted: That was you? Awesome!\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.\n","completion":" Ted: Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven.\n","completion":" Ted: You don't want to get married.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Of course I want to get married. I... It's not like I was ever going to do it. I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.\n","completion":" Ted: Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid.\n","completion":" Ted: I don't think you're stupid.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I love Marshall.\n","completion":" Ted: I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.\n"}
{"prompt":" At Duchess County\n","completion":" Ted: All done.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Ted, let's go to New Haven.\n","completion":" Ted: Lily, don't do this to yourself.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure.\n","completion":" Ted: No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, \"Yep. That was a mistake.\" So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you?\n","completion":" Ted: I don't know. You said \"mistake\" a lot. Lily, don't do this.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.\n","completion":" Ted: Forgive you for what? (Lily leaves with he car) Lily. Lily! Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road. I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk... Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you. And, also, I texted you the same thing. (He calls Barney) Hey, I need a big favor.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Anything, bro.\n","completion":" Ted: I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: No.\n","completion":" Ted: It's kind of an emergency.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: What are you doing in Duchess County?\n","completion":" Ted: Apple picking. Can you just get up here?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Don't you have a big date tonight?\n","completion":" Ted: Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: So what are you doing in Duchess County?\n","completion":" Ted: Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you.\n","completion":" Ted: No!\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.\n","completion":" Ted: No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank. I'm not in Duchess County.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County?\n","completion":" Ted: Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Need a ride, cowboy?\n","completion":" Ted: Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Hmm, too bad. I got candy.\n","completion":" Ted: Candy?!\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?\n","completion":" Ted: Nope. Sworn to secrecy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Oh, come on.\n","completion":" Ted: I like your hat.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took \"highlights\" to mean, \"I want to look like a tiger,\" hence the hat.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh. I gotta see this.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: No way.\n","completion":" Ted: Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat!\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?\n","completion":" Ted: Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.\n","completion":" Ted: Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I read that. More like \"Love in the Time of Don't Bothera.\"\n","completion":" Ted: You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: We're not indoors. We're in a van.\n","completion":" Ted: Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Never. What else?\n","completion":" Ted: She loves lasagna.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Barf.\n","completion":" Ted: You know, I am sensing a pattern here.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: What else?\n","completion":" Ted: Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: And she's looking to get married and have kids?\n","completion":" Ted: Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids.\n","completion":" Ted: Really? You don't want kids?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8:56. You're early.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, thanks for picking me up.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for.\n","completion":" Ted: Thanks.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.\n","completion":" Ted: You're going to show me your hair?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.\n","completion":" Ted: You just made my night.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice. Oh, hey, dude.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, guys.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Hi.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.\n","completion":" Ted: You think you might want to... drink the milk?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date. How'd it go, dude?\n","completion":" Ted: I didn't go.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: What? Why?\n","completion":" Ted: I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Why? She sounds perfect.\n","completion":" Ted: I don't want perfect. I want Robin.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake.\n","completion":" Ted: Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, is this milk any good?\n"}
{"prompt":" Everyone has secrets. Some are nice.\n","completion":" Ted: You know how to make crepes? That is so cool.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: And then there was Derek and counting you, that puts the total up to...\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, I got your total...counting along...\n"}
{"prompt":" Future Ted VO: And some are just weird.\n","completion":" Ted: You're scared of the Seven Dwarfs?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going.\n","completion":" Ted: What? Why not?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: No, I'm really not gonna go.\n","completion":" Ted: Come on, it'll be fun.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Barney, Lily, Marshall walk closer to Robin and talk over each other)\n","completion":" Ted: Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls. If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to. I think we should all just respect her privacy.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted and Robin lie in bed together)\n","completion":" Ted: So, what's the deal with you and malls?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, with those people. I'm your boyfriend. Come on, what is it? Did you get arrested in a mall?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: No.\n","completion":" Ted: Dumped in a mall?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: Found out you were Canadian at a mall?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Let it go.\n","completion":" Ted: Trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Robin: Let it go.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted: Trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Robin: Let it go.\n","completion":" Ted: Mauled at the mall?\n"}
{"prompt":" (Lily, Marshall, Ted and Barney sit around booth)\n","completion":" Ted: What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible.\n","completion":" Ted: I disagree. If there's some potential 'oh' moment, I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative?\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted lifts Robin's veil)\n","completion":" Ted: I love you.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox.\n","completion":" Ted: It's true. They tell each other everything.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I'm not afraid of Sasquatch. I just think we should all be on alert.\n","completion":" Ted: Trust me, not only do they tell each other everything. They want to know everything.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?\n","completion":" Ted: You know?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p0rn, wait for it, ography.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I don't know, he could be right. She does have the fake orgasm noises down.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: What? The walls are thin.\n","completion":" Ted: That's not what I'm hey-ing you about.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: You know what it might be. This is gonna sound a little crazy but what if robin's married?\n","completion":" Ted: Married? What does have to do with the mall?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Just meet with the guy.\n","completion":" Ted: She's not married. Robin hates marriage.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: No, because before Robin moved to New York, she...What was she doing?\n","completion":" Ted: Well, I don't know, whenever I ask her about Canada, she kinda clams up.\n"}
{"prompt":" (back to present scene)\n","completion":" Ted: So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it.\n","completion":" Ted: Thank you Barney.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: 'Cause it's p0rn.\n","completion":" Ted: I need another beer.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted comes back and sits down at booth)\n","completion":" Ted: All right, what if I ask Robin point-blank if she has a husband?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: You said you would respect her privacy so maybe you should just drop it.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, you're right.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Robin and Ted sit on ground around table playing Scrabble, Ted plays a word)\n","completion":" Ted: Husband.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: There's no 'p' in husband.\n","completion":" Ted: Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Robin looks at Ted)\n","completion":" Ted: Fine, I'll take it back.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted takes back his tiles)\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Huh.\n","completion":" Ted: I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Ted, I don't understand why you can't...\n","completion":" Ted: Just say, \"no, I'm not married.\"\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh.\n"}
{"prompt":" (return from commercial break)\n","completion":" Ted: You have a husband? Robin: I was young and stupid and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall and I haven't been to a mall since.\n"}

{"prompt":" Robin: He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough.\n","completion":" Ted: Good... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this.\n","completion":" Ted: OK.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I can't believe you told us Robin's secret.\n","completion":" Ted: How can I keep something like that to myself? And you begged me to tell you.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Please tell us, just tell us. I'm begging you. Tell us, tell us, tell us, please, please, please, please, please.\n","completion":" Ted: Fine, Robin's married.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us. I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you?\n","completion":" Ted: See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress.\n","completion":" Ted: What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage. It's like their money or their army. Nobody takes it seriously.\n","completion":" Ted: It's serious to me.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Marshall enters through front door, Ted working at his drafting table)\n","completion":" Ted: Hey.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Hey. Listen, dude, I gotta talk to you, but you gotta promise me that you won't tell Barney.\n","completion":" Ted: Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Robin's not married.\n","completion":" Ted: What? Then, why would she tell me she was?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I don't know but I cross-checked every record in Canada. There's no record of her ever being married.\n","completion":" Ted: There must be some mistake.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I promise you, she's not married. She's not great at parking legally either.\n","completion":" Ted: So, she lied to me? What, what am I gonna do? I can't confront her 'cause then she'll know I told you.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted and Robin in apartment talking)\n","completion":" Ted: Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Thanks Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I say we just move on.\n","completion":" Ted: In order for me to get total closure on this whole my-girlfriend-has-a-husband thing, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more information. Like, what month did you get married? Robin: June. We had a June wedding.\n"}

{"prompt":" Ted: Ah, Canada in June. That's great.\n","completion":" Ted: Sit down or buffet.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Um...\n","completion":" Ted: Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc.\n","completion":" Ted: Hm. Band of DJ?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.\n","completion":" Ted: How many bridesmaids? Robin: Seven.\n"}

{"prompt":" Robin: Um.\n","completion":" Ted: You were never married.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Yes I was.\n","completion":" Ted: No you weren't.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: How do you know?\n","completion":" Ted: I looked it up at the library.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: What library?\n","completion":" Ted: The one on 5th.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: When did you go?\n","completion":" Ted: Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad....\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use?\n","completion":" Ted: I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: You told Marshall?\n","completion":" Ted: You lied to me!\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret.\n","completion":" Ted: But it was a fake secret.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too.\n","completion":" Ted: Testing me, that's insane.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world?\n","completion":" Ted: That wasn't a real secret.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Yeah, but it could have been.\n","completion":" Ted: You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted and Robin talking)\n","completion":" Ted: I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: So I just got a very interesting phone call.\n","completion":" Ted: What are you talking about?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. No I don't.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: What?\n","completion":" Ted: Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right.\n","completion":" Ted: No, Barney, I said we're not watching this.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Barney stops video)\n","completion":" Ted: Oh my God.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: What the hell was that?\n","completion":" Ted: I slap bet Marshall that you did p0rn, so I win.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Looks like someone suffered from premature slapulation\n","completion":" Ted: Oh my God, Robin's rapping. Guys, Robin's rapping.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall, Ted: Cool.\n","completion":" Ted: Go with the 10 now.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Good call.\n","completion":" Ted: Horrible call.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin: I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin Sparkles: But, baby, I don't wanna wait.\n","completion":" Ted: No, she doesn't wanna wait.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall offers a big present to Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: Wow! What's this?\n"}

{"prompt":" Barney: That, my friend, is the Dominator 8000, the best bullwhip on the market, according to my whip guy. Yeah, I have a whip guy.\n","completion":" Ted: You know what we should do? We should...\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Finish our drinks, go out in the alley, and whip stuff.\n","completion":" Ted: God... you just get me.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: OK Ted, You got first whip!\n","completion":" Ted: All right. (imitating Clint Eastwood) Hey, dummy (to a mannequin). What did tell you about smoking in here?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall's cheek is red.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm so sorry.\n"}

{"prompt":" Another boy: And if you're a professor, where's your hat and your whip?\n","completion":" Ted: They're at home. I...\n"}
{"prompt":" IN. TED'S ROOM\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, God.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney is in the room, looking for a condom.\n","completion":" Ted: Barney, it was awful. I was teaching...\n"}
{"prompt":" IN. MC LAREN'S\n","completion":" Ted: I am freaking out. I don't think I can do this.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Would you just have the talk, okay? It's a five-minute conversation, and then you get to have s*x afterwards. It's great! Back me up, Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: I don't think the talk is necessary.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Thank you, Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: Because Robin is already his girlfriend.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: What?!\n","completion":" Ted: MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend? Simple, the rules for girls are the same as the rules for gremlins.\n","completion":" Ted: \"Gremlins\"?\n"}
{"prompt":" during the day. And rule number 3, never feed them after midnight. Meaning she doesn't sleep over and you don't have breakfast with her ever.\n","completion":" Ted: What about brunch? Is brunch cool?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: No, Ted. Brunch is not cool.\n","completion":" Ted: OK, new topic. How do I pick a tie?\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted is writing his name on the blackboard.\n","completion":" Ted: (for himself) Wait. Does professor have one \"F\" or two? Oh, my God... Oh, my God! Professor. Pro-fess-or. They're all staring at me. I don't know. Just do something! Two \"F's\". That looks right. I think that's right.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted (2030): I still hadn't decided what kind of professor I wanted to be...authoritative or cool guy. I thought I would decide in the moment. And I did. About 20 times.\n","completion":" Ted: Good morning. 'Sup, dudes? Silence! This is Architecture 101. I am Professor Mosby. But you can call me Ted. Professor Mosby. T-Dawg. Do not call me T-Dawg.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted (2030): This was it, my crossroads moment. What kind of professor was I gonna be. I had to decide.\n","completion":" Ted: Please save all your questions until the end of the lecture. Thank you! Now...\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted (2030): Yes, I was in the wrong classroom. And thus began the most humiliating seven minutes of my life.\n","completion":" Ted: Here's your think-about-it for the day. Every single person in this room... is already an architect.\n"}
{"prompt":" IN. TED'S CLASSROOM\n","completion":" Ted: Can anyone here tell me what this class is really all about?\n"}
{"prompt":" Everybody laughs.\n","completion":" Ted: Don't laugh. He's not... He's not entirely wrong. An architect must be economical in his use of space, so... well done. Looks like someone's building towards an A.\n"}
{"prompt":" IN. TED'S CLASSROOM\n","completion":" Ted: (to a student) You... Why do you want to be an architect?\n"}
{"prompt":" Student: I don't want to be an architect.\n","completion":" Ted: Yes, exactly. It's not something you want to be. It's something you need to be. You don't have a choice, right? None of you has a choice.\n"}
{"prompt":" Everybody raise their hand.\n","completion":" Ted: No questions!\n"}
{"prompt":" IN. TED'S CLASSROOM\n","completion":" Ted: So if any of you have even the slightest inclination to do anything with your life other than become an architect, you're wasting my time and yours. There's the door... You can go. I'm serious. Get out, now.\n"}
{"prompt":" They are all about to leave.\n","completion":" Ted: Wait... Don't... all leave! Architecture's fun! Look! I brought a hacky sack!\n"}
{"prompt":" Other professor: (coming into the classroom) Sorry I'm late, everyone. My name is Professor Calzonetti. This is Economics 305. You may return to your seats.\n","completion":" Ted: Sorry, sir. This is... Architecture 101. Who invited their dad, right?\n"}
{"prompt":" Professor: Young man, for the last 28 years, Economics 305 has been taught right here in building 14, room 7.\n","completion":" Ted: Euh, yeah, but, I'm sure 200 architecture students and their professor all got the room wrong.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted runs to the right classroom.\n","completion":" Ted: Kids, out of my way! Sorry. Coming through. Excuse me. Coming through.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: 20 minutes late on your first day? That's rough.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, but here's the funny thing. By that point, I didn't have time to think about what kind of teacher I was going to be. I just got up there and talked about architecture. And it was kind of great.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Congratulations, buddy.\n","completion":" Ted: Thanks.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: (from Robin's room) Hey, Ted, door five! Were you there?\n","completion":" Ted: (to Barney) Yeah, I got you, buddy. (to Marshall and Lily) They still haven't had the talk?\n"}

{"prompt":" [The Bar - Ted\/Barney\/Marshall\/Lily]\n","completion":" Ted: So, beeing married, different? Not different?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Yeah. Account info, important addresses, a letter to the other person, all that stuff. I'll get the next round.\n","completion":" Ted: Thanks.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I didn't know that I was supposed to write a letter. All Lily's gonna find in that folder are a bunch of bank statements and a funny list of things to do with my ashes.\n","completion":" Ted: Marshall brownies.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen.\n","completion":" Ted: Yes! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Whoa. Are you topless? Ted, check this out.\n","completion":" Ted: Seen 'em.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: What you are not is a massage-giving, windsurfing, bongo-playing, teetotaling, vegan, peacenik, hippy like you soon to be ex-boyfriend, Gael. Back me up here, Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm just happy Robin's happy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Please, vacation romances have an expiration date. Gael's got a \"Best if banged by\" sticker on him. Once your romance starts to stink, you'll dump his ass down the drain like sour milk and go back to being \"Unevolved Robin\", the one we actually like. Back me up here, Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm just happy Robin's happy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: This is all gonna returns to masticate you in the gluteals. Support my hypotehesis, Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm just jubilant my former paramour's jubilant.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: That guy...\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. That guy. Look at how easy he has it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Well. You and me, we have to bend over backwards to get a woman to, well, bend over backwards. But that guy... every woman in the bar is hanging on his every slightly mispronounced word. And why?\n","completion":" Ted: He's better looking than us.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: No. Because he's from out of town.\n","completion":" Ted: Mmm.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney; With an accent and an innoncent smile, you don't even have to try.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. Plus automatic out, you're leaving in a couple of days. God, I wish we were tourists.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Camera shutter clicking)\n","completion":" Ted: Okay, okay. We're from a small town in the south of France. Our plane leaves sunday morning.\n"}
{"prompt":" Girl #1: Actually, it's on its own island.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Hi, Lindsay.\n","completion":" Ted: So, hey, you-you ladies, been awful nice to us. What do you say... ah, never mind. No...\n"}
{"prompt":" Colleen: No, what is it?\n","completion":" Ted: Well, it's just we're leaving sunday morning. It sure would be nice to have some real New Yorkers show us around.\n"}
{"prompt":" Colleen: It's kind of a lame bar, but sure.\n","completion":" Ted: Really? It doesn't seem that lame to me.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lindsay: It's pretty lame.\n","completion":" Ted: I think it's cool.\n"}
{"prompt":" (They leave)\n","completion":" Ted: (yelling)I'm just saying it seems like a kind of bar a lot of cool people would hang out there.\n"}
{"prompt":" Colleen: This is our favorite restaurant in the city.\n","completion":" Ted: Yes, I'm sure this is the best of their 57 \"spudtacular\" east coast locations.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: This is the easiest date ever. You know what I'm gonna try next? A knock, knock joke.\n","completion":" Ted: Easiest? Somehow we have managed to find the two lamest new yorkers of all time.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Ted, Ted, Ted. Dude.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm looking at you. What?\n"}
{"prompt":" (They make a high-five)\n","completion":" Ted: All right, Ignatius, one more hour.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Everything's so bright, even at night. No wonder the city never sleeps. (Barney and Colleen laughing)\n","completion":" Ted: Hey. If we're going north, why did we cross over the FDR? We should have taken the Hudson.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: (scoffing) Now he knows all the streets. Someone's been watching too many \"Steinfield reruns\". (Woman laughing, Ted laughts sarcastically)\n","completion":" Ted: Where are we even going anyway?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lindsay: 148th and Brook Avenue.\n","completion":" Ted: A hundred... on the south of Bronx at this time of night? We're going to get killed.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Sirenes wails)\n","completion":" Ted: There were three of them, at least two guns... they took all our money.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: What?! This night couldn't have gone any better. We've just survived a mugging. You know what that means.\n","completion":" Ted: \"Thank God, we're alive\" s*x.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: \"Thank God we're alive\" s*x. It's even better than \"I can't believe you just proposed to me\" s*x, which I've only had, like, four of five times. Ted, please, we are so close.\n","completion":" Ted: All right. I'm in. I've never worked this hard for anything in my life.\n"}

{"prompt":" Barney: Oh, no.\n","completion":" Ted: New Jersey is not \"pretty much New York\". You are not \"pretty much new yorkers\".\n"}
{"prompt":" Colleen: And how would you know?\n","completion":" Ted: Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to \"pretty much New York\"? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey!\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: You noticed that Barney is weird lately?\n","completion":" Ted: Actually, yes. You know, he never gives flowers to a girl, because living things remind babies?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Yes.\n","completion":" Ted: The other day I saw him in a flower shop on the 82nd, he bought roses.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Where is Barney?\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. It is even more in Manhattan. Where does this girl?\n"}

{"prompt":" Barney: No, I'm for the other loser from New Jersey who barely knows karate. When I watch Karate Kid, I'm for real karate kid: Johnny Lawrence of Cobra Kai dojo. Do not get dumber than you are, Lily.\n","completion":" Ted: I just remembered where I know you. I saw you play at the theater of disorientation, Die heilige Johanna der Schlachth&ouml;fe by Bertolt Brecht, last fall. You were a revelation!\n"}

{"prompt":" Betty: You know it really theater.\n","completion":" Ted: Mrs Theatre has won my heart once and has never left me. Every year at Christmas, I created a piece for parents with all the kids.\n"}
{"prompt":" Boy: Hey, Santa, do you think we can take off with this weather?\n","completion":" Ted: Cut! Cut! Grandpa and Grandma will be there in half an hour, and you always skinned my words. I feel like I'm going to write, direct and play this thing. Give me your elf hat. Sit down.\n"}

{"prompt":" Barney: I'm not impressed by the talent here tonight. And more I drink, the less it is attractive. I'm a whiskey and Coke in the Cantina scene in Star Wars.\n","completion":" Ted: And those girls over there? They are cannon.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: There is so much to learn. You are only victims of...the effect cheerleaders. Good question. The effect cheerleading is when a group of women air cannon, but only in groups.

{"prompt":" Barney: And this, my friends, is \"the effect cheerleaders.\" Also known as the paradox of a bridesmaid syndrome sorority, and for a brief moment in the 90s, the conspiracy of the Spice Girls.Scary Spice, indeed.

{"prompt":" Robin: They sit there with their stupid bottles. They cry. They vomit. That's why babies, it sucks.\n","completion":" Ted: That's good that we have broken. I had totally forgotten your psychosis on the kids.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: My psychosis? Whenever you hear the word \"kid\", you have two small Milk tasks on your shirt.\n","completion":" Ted: God thank you, you're not my mother. You're an ice queen. All you have breastfed baby by a frozen brain.\n"}
{"prompt":" Man: Swear to always...\n","completion":" Ted: You're in good company there.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I'll see if the toilet. I also want to bring you back buffer.\n","completion":" Ted: Okay. When you have finished, you could ask a magician to heart.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: You know what? I should find another place to sleep.\n","completion":" Ted: No argument.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Well.\n","completion":" Ted: Super.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Lily is not there.\n","completion":" Ted: Your cell phone rang. I answered. Hope it bother you. Lily is at Marshall. She is fine.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: thank you God. What?\n","completion":" Ted: When storing your mobile, I found something in your bag.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I have a permit for that. And the other thing is a gift.\n","completion":" Ted: You've stolen the Ca sock Jeremy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: No. I do not know what she's doing there. It must have fallen into it. Bizarre!\n","completion":" Ted: \"Falling in? \"\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Or Lily put it there for fun. That bitch is stuffed. I took it.It's just... so cute. Sock.\n","completion":" Ted: Robin Scherbatsky, you get the idea of having children?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I know. One day, perhaps. When I'm 70. Science will catch me. I'm just... I'm lost right now. I'm unemployed, I live on a couch.\n","completion":" Ted: There were two difficult months both. I have a room free.Why not come to me in the meantime?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Really?\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: The last great idea for Fathers Day-No, a pregnancy test, but instead of a blue line, there is a small blue Barney who does that.\n","completion":" Ted: Day of Non-Fathers, it sucks. It's a feast for the losers.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: What are you talking? This is a good group of friends.\n","completion":" Ted: This is the effect cheerleaders.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Look at these guys, individually. These geniuses are not childless by choice, my friend.\n","completion":" Ted: Good night, Barney.\n"}
{"prompt":" Future Ted VO: And me making the coffee. I had this coffeepot that was probably 50 years old at that time, and it made truly terrible coffee. We called it Shocky\n","completion":" Ted: Plugging in.\n"}
{"prompt":" (back to Lily and Robin telling this story to Ted and Marshall)\n","completion":" Ted: No way. You're making this up.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: My apartment is a Chinese restaurant. What am I gonna do?\n","completion":" Ted: Come live with us.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Really?\n","completion":" Ted: Of course.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: You sure about this, Ted?\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: No, it's like it'll change everything. Oh, Ted, you are so screwed.\n","completion":" Ted: What? What are you talking about?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, so?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right?\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, we've talked about it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: So, when Lily and I get married, who's gonna get the apartment?\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, that's a tough one. You know who I think could handle a problem like that?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Who?\n","completion":" Ted: Future Ted and Future Marshall.\n"}
{"prompt":" (back to Ted, Barney and Robin in bar)\n","completion":" Ted: Dammit Past Ted\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out.\n","completion":" Ted: That's crazy. They're not edging me out. Marshall's my best friend.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Barney exhales loudly)\n","completion":" Ted: One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Sort of on a date with her.\n","completion":" Ted: What?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile. (evil laugh) But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.\n","completion":" Ted: All right.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: You're going to the hospital?\n","completion":" Ted: No, see, he's gonna go back over there and I'm gonna call him and he's gonna pretend that it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?\n","completion":" Ted: He's gonna want the apartment. I'm gonna want the apartment. It's gonna lead to an argument, so no.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it.\n","completion":" Ted: I should really make this call.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Lily is painting by fireplace, Ted is sitting on couch drinking coffee, Marshall is at table studying)\n","completion":" Ted: Ah, this'll be nice, the three of us living together. I think it's a good setup.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Marshall smiles at Ted and Lily, Lily smiles back)\n","completion":" Ted: Man, this coffee's great. It's really great. Too great.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted puts down coffee cup and runs to kitchen and sees a different coffeemaker)\n","completion":" Ted: What happened to Shocky?\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted carries new coffeemaker into living room)\n","completion":" Ted: What's this? Lily: My coffeemaker from my apartment. Makes great coffee, right?\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted: What's this? Lily: My coffeemaker from my apartment. Makes great coffee, right?\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, definitely. I mean, so does Shocky.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kinda rusty.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, no, it did. I mean, I kinda liked the rusty taste. I'm used to it. I don't know.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Also Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock you.\n","completion":" Ted: No. You gotta admit, that shock, wakes you up in the morning\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: You know what else wakes you up in the morning? Coffee.\n","completion":" Ted: That's great. You're right. Roomies! I love it.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Robin, Ted and Barney sitting at table)\n","completion":" Ted: They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she!\n","completion":" Ted: It's not just the coffeemaker.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: That is great.\n","completion":" Ted: Nice.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I don't know. Um, over the piano?\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, that would be a good place for it. Too bad the swords are there. We kinda love those swords.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Well, those swords have been up there a long time.\n","completion":" Ted: I know, right? I'd really miss them too. So, maybe Marshall's room?\n"}
{"prompt":" (Robin, Ted, and Barney at table)\n","completion":" Ted: He was gonna take the swords down. Can you believe that?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big.\n","completion":" Ted: What, like buy a new sofa?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Your English phone booth arrived.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, awesome. It's great, right?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Yeah, I guess. Just not sure if Lily's gonna like it.\n","completion":" Ted: Well, I like it, so I'm just gonna keep it right here, if that's cool.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Of course, we all live here so we should all be able to have things the way we want them.\n","completion":" Ted: Exactly.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Marshall takes swords down and throws them down on the ground, hangs painting in their place)\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, so it's like that, is it?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Yeah, it's like that.\n","completion":" Ted: I want this apartment.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted and Marshall talking)\n","completion":" Ted: All right Marshall, we're deciding right now who gets this apartment. It may lead to an argument, but we're settling this.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Or we could flip a coin.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, let's flip a coin.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Flip it.\n","completion":" Ted: OK, I'm flipping it, here I go.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Flip it.\n","completion":" Ted: OK, here I go.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Flip it.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm flipping. But before I do, I just wanna say something. You didn't even wanna move in here in the first place. You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: That was five years ago. Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter. Oh snap. What else you got?\n","completion":" Ted: OK, I'm flipping. Heads or tails.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: You don't need two rooms\n","completion":" Ted: Heads or tails, Marshall. Like you need two rooms?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: We might be starting a family soon.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, no you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're in law school. It's gonna be at least three years.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: It could be sooner, we're not that careful with our birth control Two-zip.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, come on, you know damn well I move out that room's going unused.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Oh, and I suppose you'll get a new roommate? Who's it gonna be? Barney? You know he cooks naked.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the swords down.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted runs over to the swords, picks up a sword)\n","completion":" Ted: We were bros! These swords represent our bro-hood. And you took 'em down to make room for your fiance's stupid painting?\n"}
{"prompt":" (Marshall picks up other sword) Marshall: Lily's a part of who I am. And if you're such a bro, she's a part of who you are too. She's a bro by extension.\n","completion":" Ted: I deserve this apartment, Marshall.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Marshall taps Ted's sword with his sword)\n","completion":" Ted: Great, so let's flip for it.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted gets ready to flip coin, Ted and Marshall start sword fighting)\n","completion":" Ted: So, is this how we're deciding who gets the apartment?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I guess so.\n","completion":" Ted: How are we doing this exactly? Is this like to the death?\n"}
{"prompt":" (Marshall swipes at Ted, Ted jumps back and falls into chair)\n","completion":" Ted: It's OK, it's OK.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Ted gets up and goes to other side of room)\n","completion":" Ted: Can I observe something?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: That this is kinda awesome?\n","completion":" Ted: Totally.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I can't believe we didn't do this before.\n","completion":" Ted: I know!\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: That was awesome.\n","completion":" Ted: I know.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Do it again.\n","completion":" Ted: OK, but this time, jump up and I'll swipe your legs.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Marshall and Ted hit swords, Ted spins around and they hit swords again, Marshall jumps up and Ted swipes sword beneath his feet, the continue sword fight)\n","completion":" Ted: Look. Here's why I should get the place. You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates. And on top of that I could be homeless. Does that seem fair?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Oh, boo-freakin-hoo.\n","completion":" Ted: What?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Woe is me. I'm not married yet. My ovaries are shrinking. Ted, if you wanted to be married by now you would be but you're not. And you know why? Because you're irrationally picky. You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.\n","completion":" Ted: Anhedonic?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Anhedonic. It means you can't enjoy anything.\n","completion":" Ted: The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down.\n","completion":" Ted: That's OK, it led to this totally rad sword fight, didn't it?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: You remember when we first got these swords?\n","completion":" Ted: It was the day we moved in.\n"}
{"prompt":" (flashback to day they moved in, Marshall is assembling coffee table, Ted just mounted swords on wall)\n","completion":" Ted: Congratulations, Marshall. We live in an apartment with swords on the wall.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: List of lifelong dreams, you're not half as long. Crap. I'm missing one of the screws for this table\n","completion":" Ted: Just use this wood glue, it'll hold.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fiancé.\n","completion":" Ted: Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fiancé? I'm kidding. Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment. Marshall: But you fought so bravely for it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted: Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fiancé? I'm kidding. Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment. Marshall: But you fought so bravely for it.\n","completion":" Ted: I wasn't fighting for the apartment. I was fighting for...I don't know...for everything to stay the way it is. But I'm not gonna get that, so, seriously, take the place, it's yours.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: But you're totally...\n","completion":" Ted: Just let him have this one.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: You're right. I'm sorry. We were fighting to see who gets the apartment. And I won.\n","completion":" Ted: Uh, you didn't win. I gave it to you.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I will too. We're not getting married for like a year.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem. Let that guy deal with it.\n"}
{"prompt":" (Robin, Marshall, Lily, Ted, and Barney sitting around table)\n","completion":" Ted: Chinese restaurant, I still don't believe it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Antoni Gaudí was both.\n","completion":" Ted: There are jerk faces and there are buttholes.\n"}
{"prompt":" They kiss... Robin and Ted dancing...\n","completion":" Ted: So...\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: So...\n","completion":" Ted: Wedding's over.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Yes, it is.\n","completion":" Ted: I guess starting tomorrow, we can tell people.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Tell people what?\n","completion":" Ted: The food looks delicious, doesn't it?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Oh, okay. Tell people what?\n","completion":" Ted: Can we talk about this later?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what?\n","completion":" Ted: Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Okay. (Barney leaves)\n","completion":" Ted: Whoo, that was a close one.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Oh, God! Okay. Look, we have some... news.\n","completion":" Ted: But we don't want to draw attention away from Lily and Marshall's big day.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Fine.\n","completion":" Ted: It's pretty big, though.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: All right, let's run some interference.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, we'll get you back to your table. Come on.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Oh, yes, definitely.\n","completion":" Ted: How about a slide show of you guys through the years set to Green Day's \"Time of Your Life\" and ending with your baby photos side by side.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: We've done it. A wedding with zero clichées.\n","completion":" Ted: Wait, isn't doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a clichée?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Are those mini quiches? (Marshall and Lily run) Tell the secret.\n","completion":" Ted: Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew.\n","completion":" Ted: What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives.\n"}
{"prompt":" Waiter: Compliments of the house.\n","completion":" Ted: Wow. Thanks. Cheers.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away.(Lily and Marshall leave) So what was in the glass?\n","completion":" Ted: Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, \"Champagne?\" \"We didn't order any champagne.\" \"Compliments of the house.\" \"Wow.\"\n"}
{"prompt":" this to me. No. No, no, no!\n","completion":" Ted: That's what she said.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no.\n","completion":" Ted: What are you talking about?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here.\n","completion":" Ted: That's not mine.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: What?\n","completion":" Ted: That's not mine.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Wow. That was hilarious. I was like... what? Anyway.\n","completion":" Ted: What the hell was that?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: What the hell was what?\n","completion":" Ted: That reaction?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I thought you were proposing to me.\n","completion":" Ted: Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Ted, you know how I feel about marriage.\n","completion":" Ted: Now more than ever.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight?\n","completion":" Ted: No.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Then why is this an issue?\n","completion":" Ted: Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, \"No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. \"Ted, you cannot do this to me. \"No. No, no, no.\"\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go?\n","completion":" Ted: No.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: I had four strawberries.\n","completion":" Ted: Was there a side of champagne with each of the strawberries?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Ted, don't do this.\n","completion":" Ted: No, seriously. Where do you see yourself in five years?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Where do you see yourself?\n","completion":" Ted: Honestly, in five years... I probably want to be married.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: And I probably want to be in Argentina.\n","completion":" Ted: Argentina?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure.\n","completion":" Ted: We have an expiration date, don't we?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it.\n","completion":" Ted: Barney... story's not over.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home?\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, of course. Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this. Can we actually...\n"}
{"prompt":" Waiter: Oh, my God, it's you.\n","completion":" Ted: Wha... what?\n"}
{"prompt":" Waiter: You're the son of a bitch who stole our blue French horn.\n","completion":" Ted: Run!\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Run? Your strategy was run?\n","completion":" Ted: It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted and Robin run and knock down the tray that the waiter was holding, at Robin's apartment...\n","completion":" Ted: I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license till we bring the horn back.\n"}
{"prompt":" Flashback, at the restaurant...\n","completion":" Ted: Look, I'm sorry about the French horn. I want to make this right. So what we're going to do right now is, we're going to run!\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted runs and fall. End of flashback..\n","completion":" Ted: So... Argentina.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Argentina.\n","completion":" Ted: Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there.\n","completion":" Ted: I could want to live in Argentina.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too. They have buildings in Argentina. And Paris. And even Tokyo. I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?\n","completion":" Ted: Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Oh, shut up.\n","completion":" Ted: You're scared I might not be kidding.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Aren't you?\n","completion":" Ted: Nope. Your move, Scherbatsky.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: You caught the bouquet?\n","completion":" Ted: Barney. The story's not over yet.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Wait, wait, wait, wait.\n","completion":" Ted: What?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I don't know if I can do this to you.\n","completion":" Ted: Do what?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids.\n","completion":" Ted: Oh, right. 'Cause there are no kids there. On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black \"X\" over Argentina.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: You know what I mean.\n","completion":" Ted: No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Well, we probably shouldn't.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Risk it?\n","completion":" Ted: Risk it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Man: God, this guy's giving me nothing.\n","completion":" Ted: All right, have fun in Scotland. If you see the Loch Ness Monster, tell him Ted Mosby says, \"What's up?\"\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Nessie's a she, Ted, come on. Marshall and Lily leave.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, kiddo.\n"}
{"prompt":" BarneyYou are going to miss out on a lot of awesome stuff. You'll be at home with the kid while I am out awesome-ing all over the place. And you're going to get fat.\n","completion":" Ted: The story's not over, Barney.\n"}
{"prompt":" Flashback\n","completion":" Ted: Okay, time to get the horn back to the bistro.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again. That tuckered me out.\n","completion":" Ted: Not a euphemism.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Right. Okay, let me just go change, and we'll leave.\n","completion":" Ted: Whoa, whoa, you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh. Solidarity, sister.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: That is crazy. I have a change of clothes and you don't. Suck it up.\n","completion":" Ted: Well, if we'd actually moved in together, all my stuff would be here, but we didn't, so...\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Yeah. We were all talk, weren't we?\n","completion":" Ted: We're not doing this, are we?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: I don't want to have kids in Argentina.\n","completion":" Ted: And I don't want to have kids in Argentina.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: So where does that leave us?\n","completion":" Ted: Well... we could stay together and... pretend this stuff doesn't matter. Or... we could give back the blue French horn.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: You stole a blue French horn for me.\n","completion":" Ted: I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: You did break up.\n","completion":" Ted: Yep.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: An-And Marshall and Lily don't know?\n","completion":" Ted: Well, afterwards, uh, we came by to tell you guys, but Lily was pretty stressed out, so...\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: You guys okay?\n","completion":" Ted: Well, it hasn't been the easiest two weeks of our lives, but...\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: But we're okay.\n","completion":" Ted: The open bar helps.\n"}
{"prompt":" Kid: Could I have this dance?\n","completion":" Ted: Well, we knew this day would come eventually. Take care of her, little man.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: I'm really sorry about you and Robin. I know I was always joking around about wanting you two to break up, but you were really good together.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: The one. Oh, Ted, no. Do not tell me you're going to start searching for \"the one\" again. The only time I want to hear you saying \"the one\" is if it's followed by the word \"hundredth.\" What up?\n","completion":" Ted: No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Really? 'Cause... you know, you've been in a relationship for a year. You're going to... be a little rusty.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: I'm just saying... you're gonna need, need, need some help out there.\n","completion":" Ted: Could be.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Ted?\n","completion":" Ted: Yes, Barney.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Do you think... Do you think maybe you might... need a wingman again?\n","completion":" Ted: I do.\n"}
{"prompt":" At Marvin's funeral\n","completion":" Ted: This is the toughest time in Marshall's life and I feel absolutely useless. What can we do to help?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Well, uh, I've been to a couple funerals, so I know my role: I'm Vice Girl. Whatever Marshall needs to get through this day, I got it right here.\n","completion":" Ted: Cigarettes, alcohol... Are these firecrackers? My God, Robin, you somehow crammed Tijuana into a purse.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Okay, yes, Judy and I aren't besties, but today, whatever she needs, I'm there. I'm on Judy duty.\n","completion":" Ted: \"Judy duty.\"\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Really, guys? At a funeral?\n","completion":" Ted: Uh, okay, while not all of us possess your lofty sense of decorum, Drug-DealerFrom-An-'80s-After-School-Special, we have to laugh today. It's healthy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Ted, what's the one thing that always cracks him up?\n","completion":" Ted: Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts, exactly! So we are gonna get our bro a four-star nad rattler. You search knees, feet, banisters, fire hydrants and diving boards, and I'll cover bats, rackets, hockey sticks, golf clubs and riding crops.\n","completion":" Ted: What about animals?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Wow, you really do have everything in there, don't you?\n","completion":" Ted: You're like Mary Poppins, if her magic purse was also filled with drugs.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Marshall Eriksen, you could use a laugh.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah! This video is entitled, \"Little League Coach Gets Hit in the Nuts by a Foul Ball and Then Vomits in a Garbage Can.\" I don't wanna give anything away. Let's just watch.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: See? 'Cause, 'cause he got hit...\n","completion":" Ted:...right in the nuts,\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Trey Platt. I can't believe my father's funeral service is being led by Trey \"The Noogie Machine\" Platt.\n","completion":" Ted: That guy gave you noogies? What, did he carry a stepladder?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: This next clip is entitled, \"Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets Hit in the Nuts by Low-Flying Seagull\"\n","completion":" Ted: Let's see what happens.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Here he comes... Oh! Oh! 'Cause he gets hit right in the nuts.\n","completion":" Ted: And then the fat kid loses his swim trunks.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: You should listen to it. Just don't put too much pressure on it.\n","completion":" Ted: She's right. I mean, this idea that someone's last words have to be profound and meaningful? I mean, who can live up to that?\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: The point is, last words are overrated.\n","completion":" Ted: Look, think of it this way: you get to hear your dad's voice one last time.\n"}
{"prompt":" [END OF FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: Whoa. Are you okay?\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: Judy's finally sleeping and it's all because of me! Guys, I have a role: I'm Judy's bitch! Yeah!\n","completion":" Ted: Well, but this day is tough on you, too. You sure you can absorb all that?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Guys, guys, what if-- God forbid-- all of your dads died right now? What would their last words to you have been? Seriously.\n","completion":" Ted: I know mine. When I was in Cleveland last month, I went to visit my dad at his... post-divorce bachelor pad.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted's dad: Been fun bro-ing out with you tonight, T-Dawg.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah... so glad we can we can talk about our s*x lives now. That's totally an improvement.\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted's dad: I hooked up with a younger woman the other week-- Donna Bromstead.\n","completion":" Ted: My prom date?!\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted's dad: How far did you get, T-Dawg?\n","completion":" Ted: I have to go.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: How would you like those to be your father's last words?\n","completion":" Ted: Well, they might be. Donna Bromstead's husband is a cop.\n"}
{"prompt":" [END OF FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: That's awful.\n"}
{"prompt":" Lily: That salad's the first food she's eaten in two days. Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise and jelly beans, but it counts.\n","completion":" Ted: Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Marshall laugh once.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Yeah. Showing videos of guys getting hit in the nuts wasn't going to do anything. I'm just stupid.\n","completion":" Ted: Stupid.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: What we need to do is hit each other in the nuts.\n","completion":" Ted: Yes. Nothing beats the immediacy of live theater. But which one of us is going to take the hit?(Barney hits Ted in the nuts) So that's it? No discussion?\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: I'm not going to listen. \"Rent Crocodile Dundee II\" are the last words that my father will ever say to me, and I think I can live with that.\n","completion":" Ted: Is he laughing?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney, his voice breaking: Lame.\n","completion":" Ted: These stories suck.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Oh, man. I should have rented Crocodile Dundee III.\n","completion":" Ted: Okay, seriously, how are you doing that?\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted is making a phone call\n","completion":" Ted: Hi, Dad.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney's office\n","completion":" Ted: I love your idea about a giant rooftop ring of fire you can jump through with a motorcycle, but I tweaked it slightly and... This is still super bad-ass. It's now a patio garden where you can bring a nice bag lunch.\n"}
{"prompt":" Transvestite: Hi, handsome. Lookin' for a date?\n","completion":" Ted: Uh, no, thank you. Still got it.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney's office\n","completion":" Ted: Barney, we have to talk.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney's Secretary: But there's an urgent memo for Mr. Mosby.\n","completion":" Ted: \"Dary.\"\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Legendary! So, what's on your mind?\n","completion":" Ted: I can't design the building.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: You're kidding me.\n","completion":" Ted: I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Snakes.\n","completion":" Ted: Did you just say \"snakes\"?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: I don't recall saying \"snakes\". Ted, I know you love crappy old stuff no one cares about. But I'm gonna give you four words to live by: New is always better.\n","completion":" Ted: New is always better?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better.\n","completion":" Ted: Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Everything.\n","completion":" Ted: So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law.\n","completion":" Ted: And when you're at a Guns n' Roses concert, you're like, \"Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy\"?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Axl's really matured as a songwriter, Ted.\n","completion":" Ted: Wendy! I'd like to buy my friend a drink. What's your oldest Scotch?\n"}
{"prompt":" Wendy: Glenmckenna, aged 30 years in oak casks.\n","completion":" Ted: Amazing. And what's your newest scotch?\n"}
{"prompt":" Wendy: Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch. Don't let it touch your skin.\n","completion":" Ted: Your call, buddy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Lily told you.\n","completion":" Ted: Told him what?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Speaking of disappointing weenies... Ted, tell them what you told me.\n","completion":" Ted: I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building.\n"}
{"prompt":" Robin: Duh. Of course there's a girl.\n","completion":" Ted: What? I... There's no g-girl. Why would you even... Her name is Zoey.\n"}
{"prompt":" Woman: Beautiful building, right?\n","completion":" Ted: Look, mister, you are very convincing, and I am very flattered. Confused, even. But I'm not looking...\n"}
{"prompt":" [END OF FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: Not only is she funny, hot and genetically female, but get this...\n"}
{"prompt":" [END OF FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream!\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Whose dream?\n","completion":" Ted: We wound up talking for hours.\n"}
{"prompt":" Woman: I love how old parts of the city are. Hmm. It makes me feel connected to history.\n","completion":" Ted: Old is always better. I can't wait to be old.\n"}
{"prompt":" Woman: Me, too. You can wear elastic everything. Your lipstick doesn't have to stay inside the lines.\n","completion":" Ted: You can shoplift and pretend you're just confused.\n"}
{"prompt":" Woman: You could nap anywhere. Uh-huh. Even while driving. It's gonna be great. I can't wait to be all run-down and weathered and wrinkly.\n","completion":" Ted: Well, I'd say you got a pretty long wait.\n"}
{"prompt":" Woman: Hey, Ted, can I ask you something\n","completion":" Ted: Anything.\n"}
{"prompt":" [FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: Where do I sign?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs?\n","completion":" Ted: This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: Whoa! Sweet wrestling name alert.\n","completion":" Ted: Well... Uh, it's a... it's a funny thing about that...\n"}
{"prompt":" Zoey: So what do you do, Ted?\n","completion":" Ted: I'm a veterinarian.\n"}
{"prompt":" [END OF FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: What? I panicked!\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl.\n","completion":" Ted: I don't do that.\n"}
{"prompt":" [FLASHBACKS]\n","completion":" Ted: Well, off to meet Steph. We're adrenaline junkies! [...]Penelope is taking me to the Battle of Gettysburg. We're gonna eat squirrel! [...] (Ted enters the living room, dressed up as a wizard) Look, she's really hot, okay?\n"}
{"prompt":" [END OF FLASHBACKS]\n","completion":" Ted: Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Asian girls love them some Jews.\n","completion":" Ted: And Marshall never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily.\n"}
{"prompt":" Marshall: And you're welcome.\n","completion":" Ted: The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: No. Technically, they were eggs.\n","completion":" Ted: Did you just say \"eggs\"?\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted from 2030: As I was mustering the courage to call Zoey and tell her my true identity...\n","completion":" Ted: Zoey... I'm Batman. Hmm. That'd be cool.\n"}
{"prompt":" Zoey: I need your help. (They go outside. Zoey opens the back doors of a truck) Just to warn you. What I'm about to show you is not a hundred percent legal.\n","completion":" Ted: Wasn't expecting bunnies.\n"}
{"prompt":" Zoey: I stole them, Ted. My animal rights group liberated these guys from an evil cosmetics company. And I figured, \"Hey, Ted's a vet. He can check them out and make sure they're okay.\"\n","completion":" Ted: Absolutely. Just let me run up and get my bag of vet supplies. Okay. Why would I say that?\n"}
{"prompt":" At the back of Zoey's truck\n","completion":" Ted: You just broke in and stole these guys? Aren't you worried about getting arrested?\n"}
{"prompt":" Zoey: Nah. I've been arrested lots of times. Chinese Democracy.\n","completion":" Ted: Wow. You're a little bit crazy.\n"}
{"prompt":" Zoey: Well, I'm usually crazy for a good cause. I can't just sit by while voiceless people or animals, r even buildings et screwed over. 'm certainly not going o just sit by hile GNB turns The Arcadian nto a soulless metal box.\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah. Yeah. Although I hear there's a lovely rooftop patio where folks can enjoy a nice bag lunch, so...\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?!\n","completion":" Ted: Solid C-cup, perky bounce.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Momentary grudging respect.\n","completion":" Ted: Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Ted, that is never gonna happen.\n","completion":" Ted: Well, I can't tear down The Arcadian. I'm sorry, but I'm off the project.\n"}
{"prompt":" Man: Oh, bummer!\n","completion":" Ted: Hey.\n"}
{"prompt":" Zoey: Hey, Ted. I'm so glad you came.\n","completion":" Ted: Well, you really got to me the other night. I want to get involved with \"Save The Arcadian.\"\n"}
{"prompt":" Man: Dude, why are you dressed like a wizard?\n","completion":" Ted: She was really hot, okay?\n"}
{"prompt":" (Barney is on the couch, holding a rabbit)\n","completion":" Ted: How the hell could you do that?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door.\n","completion":" Ted: The billboard, Barney.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: I had to. Now that you have no shot with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal.\n","completion":" Ted: You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump!\n","completion":" Ted: Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?!\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail.\n","completion":" Ted: You named the rabbit?\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her. The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building. Dude, you can do whatever you want with it.\n","completion":" Ted: You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want.\n"}
{"prompt":" Barney: So you're back in?\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":" Zoey: Well, hope you don't mind, we made some changes to the billboard.\n","completion":" Ted: Well, that explains a few voicemails. Listen, Zoey, I think we can save The Arcadian. No. Maybe not in the way you were picturing, but I stayed up all night working on a new concept, all right? What if my design could incorporate The Arcadian's facade into the new GNB headquarters?\n"}
{"prompt":" Ted from 2030: Kids, it was one of those moments in life where everything comes together... the girl, the building, everything, until...\n","completion":" Ted: Are you married?\n"}
{"prompt":" [FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.\n"}
{"prompt":" [END OF FLASHBACK]\n","completion":" Ted: Yeah, it was about the girl.\n"}
{"prompt":" Zoey: Ted, wh-wh-what are you doing?\n","completion":" Ted: This wouldn't work. Zoey, The Arcadian was a really great building once, but it's falling apart, and it's full of snakes.\n"}
{"prompt":" Zoey: Snakes?\n","completion":" Ted: I don't recall saying snakes.\n"}
{"prompt":" Max: Yeah, well, there's this... kind of weird thing she likes to do in the bedroom.\n","completion":" Ted: Hey, what's not for everyone?\n"}
