{"prompt":"","completion":"  That security guard was a little bit handsy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job? Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do? I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night dreaming about being a... I mean, uh... This is a cool job."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Your uniforms are pretty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Could you just call the firm and explain what happened?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ooh, he's starting!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, he never even called you back?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What was the name of the airline again?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Was the \"R\" backwards?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Geez."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Marshall? Oh, my God!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That really wasn't my fault. I wouldn't have walked in on"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, what's going on here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, but for what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are you serious?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is the place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You said wang."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's kind of annoying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Get out of here!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Marshall?! Oh, my God! (Marshall falls)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store, we would have made the first flight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, yes, I am. I can't believe you recognized me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out for a wedding dress?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it's not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, what's going on?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, but for what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there, and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All, right, well, thanks for trying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, come on. Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today. Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Or maybe he was. Think about it. The way that she bats her eyelashes and shakes her tail feathers in his face? (chuckles) She wants it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  For the love of God, will one of you idiots hang up the phone?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I don't think you know what Spain is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's graduation goggles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Graduation goggles, like with high school. It's four years of bullies making fun of all the kids with braces, even after the braces come off and they can walk just fine. But then, on graduation day, you suddenly get all misty because you realize you're never going to see those jerks again. I just had graduation goggles with that guy Scooby I dated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful. (as speaking to a dog): He was a good boy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ...so, if the Landmarks Preservation Committee sides with Zoey, your whole project goes down the tubes? You must be furious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hershel?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (Robin is standing at the door) Oh, my God!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You don't remember?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why not?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... (quietly): ticking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Huh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What is wrong with you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"What a nice surprise\"? No, a nice surprise would have been a safe falls from 40 stories e crushes them both. You let yourself do?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're f*cked up. He f*cked up, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So big, that when you sit next to on the plane, you wonder if the check would not have had to buy two seats."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Handling a police officer with your sausage. It's sexy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're wrong about that, man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is outrageous! And relevant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How was your lunch with the rich? It started well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, it looks like this guy asks you to design..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's it. A house of horror."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can not do this house!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You did break Tony and Stella? Really sorry, but I must insist that you topes there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll wait."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  False. This has never happened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're lying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted said it was okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh my god lily, have you seen this kitchen?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What the hell are you doing? You can't buy this place; lily you have a debt of the size of Mount Waddington!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's the tallest mountain in Canada. It's like 4000 meters high."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ro, don't let Marshall fall in love with this apartment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I-I don't know, tell him, tell him you saw a ghost. Tell him it's haunted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  you should be a reality show."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, let me get this straight. You just snuck this girl into some stranger's apartment?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait. That time that you offered to walk my dogs when i went to visit my dad in Vancouver..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wh-what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What do you mean?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, God here we go. He had a detective club as a kid."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The Mosby boys? You mean you and your sister."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let me guess, it was in the garbage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A water bott."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ew, that was on the floor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Ted!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Which Is why this picture is crooked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know what they've been fighting..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know what they were fighting about, and it wasn't peanut butter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They were fighting because they didn't get the loan and it's all Lily's fault."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, she has a pile of debt the size of mount... Rushmore"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, it's been nice knowing you guys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, Marshall's gonna get yyou guys, Lily's gonna get me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's a little weird."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They're back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So you're not getting a divorce?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So what's the annoucement?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We had our first fight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's this big skyscraper in Spokane. It'd be a huge project for his firm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And then it got ugly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like Die Hard. But Field of Dreams? Once is more than enough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I guess I don't know how to do that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I wonder where Ted went."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, we'll swing by the party."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, that's the young lady."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing. Ted hates clubs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to s*x."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's not answering. Calling Marshall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, okay. Bye. (She hangs up) Marshall just lied. Ted's cheating on me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier. One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair. And the other's a cheating b*st*rd."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So these guys... One of them's an architect."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's the one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know this girl. Where does she live?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm cashed, too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My purse?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse. No room for my gun. Here. Now where does the rodeo slut live?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah... And steal her purse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can't believe he's cheating on me. You know how many times I could have cheated? Six... no seven. And you know two of them, and they would surprise you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Should I just kick the door in?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm the problem."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You were right. I don't know how to be a girlfriend. I took the nicest guy in the world and I made him a cheater."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let's do this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What do you think you're...? Barney?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How did you get here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But why would you use Ted's name?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Everything isn't okay. Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And that's why I avoid relationships."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I brought donuts. And I don't want to brag, but they're filled with jelly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was... fine. Nothing exciting. How was yours?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, I do. I'm sorry about earlier. To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of Field of Dreams. I fell asleep half way through."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause... You know what, um... What I'm trying to say is... I love being the person you bitch to. So how was your day, Mr. Architect?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Obviously. Wow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, you didn't mention all the foliage around the base. If you trim that back, the rest would look bigger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. Ted, this is amazing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know. It might come to something. You know, girls find architects very hot. (They kiss)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Guys, I dated you both, and neither of you is good at pressing or even finding the button. After some awkward pawing around, that building's going to fake an implosion, say, \"Baby, that was great\"\" and go to sleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's just a button, okay? Can we just talk about something else, please?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's the first time since the breakup. How's she doing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know that \"coffee\" is code for \"I want to get back together\" right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, that's sweet, Lil, but didn't you guys get food poisoning here one time?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Mr. Architect, big day for you tomorrow, huh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You okay?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey. Everything okay?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I bet it's her tushie."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why would Ted just give up the button like that? And he forgot his phone. \"See you in an hour.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, Ted's gone back for less."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Get it together, bro."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, Zoey wrote, \"Meet me at 6:00, where it all began, where you gave me the orchid at the intersection.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Aw, that's sweet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I was in a coma. I mean, who pays attention to that sappy romantic crap?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Great. He could be anywhere. We're flat out of clues."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, we're never gonna find him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's in Brooklyn. How are we ever gonna get there in time?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can't believe Ted's getting back together with Zoey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Unmitigated disaster."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I guess I get it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, no matter how bad things got... Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, she did."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, where the hell are they?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, maybe it is and we're too late. Man, I wish we'd gone to Brooklyn sooner."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait. Where'd you get that? (The guy is holding a cup, on which is printed \"The Intersection\")"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait a minute. On their first date, he brought her an orchid. How much do you want to bet he's gonna do it again?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can't get back together with Zoey just because you're freaking out over a lightbulb."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, Ted, the future is scary. But you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar. Yes, it's tempting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm proud of you for giving Ted the button. It meant a lot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dear Marshall, I know this is a strange way to apologize, but I'm sorry I let Carl name your drink after me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And that's the only time my father ever said he was proud of me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you so much."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can always do prof."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on. This is boring! I knew it was a bad idea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait. Before that, I must tell you something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think I love you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think I love you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You must be right. Have fun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  sh1t."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know since when?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And you've said anything since? Bravo."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know since when?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I will do what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll marry Barney in a large church. We'll move to New Hampshire and open cottages."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No! This is Barney. I mean... This is Barney. But it's Barney. I have to say no."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're right. For the first time he likes a girl, she pushes him away? And not just any girl. It's going to destroy it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The Mosby?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What is the Mosby?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I was ready to jump the turnstile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The Mosby! It's great! And... excuse me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? Yes. Much."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn, Lily!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's just... You mean to me, Barney. And... This kind of stuff, the emotional side. This is not your type. I thought you avoid that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe. I know not. I am not good to face the feelings.There is clearly something... between us. Maybe my head said, \"stifles it in the bud\" because my heart said... something else. Listen... I feel for you. Maybe even that I love you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But no."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're right. I've just mosbyser."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Because I'm afraid of how I could love you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're right. There must be a mistake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I love you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Friends, then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let's get married."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, forget it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, let's go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I am a TV reporter. I am on the air at 4am."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What someone looks, please."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I was gonna go with \"chastity bracelet.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Anyway, speaking of engaged, check out what got back from being resized."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn it, ring!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, you're right--"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Actually, I'm thinking about getting a dog again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   You wouldn't have to take care of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Yeah, that was made out of silk, Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Here we go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   I don't know. This will be your second date."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Oh, hey, guys. This is Nate. Nate, these are my friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   What? You told me to meet someone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Actually, I met him in the park."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Okay, but you have to admit that he is a lot of fun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   And what is he?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   What? You saw him hitting on someone?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   That last one did not happen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   He's not a dog."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Guys, just stop hounding him. Oh, geez."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Hey, Nate, why don't you go play some music on the jukebox."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Oh, shoot, dropped my keys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Well, it's still early."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Unbelievable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm lost."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Sorry, toots. He's taken."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Oh, no. I got called back in to work. Can you keep an eye on him until I get back? He's new to the city, and he doesn't really know anyone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   He's not a... Good night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   \"Got out\"? What do you mean?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Guys. Get yourselves together and start looking for Scooby. I'm on my way home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Hey, have you seen Scooby?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can not. I am in Tokyo. This is my first week. I can not leave like this. In addition, I am finally serious information."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The board of the Fed voted not to change the... rates."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, I'll be there. I gotta go. Good evening. And I'm Robin Scherbatsky. The talks have been arrested in the Middle East. Despite a promising start in the final negotiations, the talks foundered on security."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Your new husband dismounted me out three times a day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Driven by concerns about the environment and oil prices, sales of hybrid vehicles rose 11% over last year."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm off to the airport."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What did Ted this time?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I understand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's OK. Can you imagine not traveling I did. I was on a plane, a whole day. But it was worth it to see you get married.How I would have missed it..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  thank you God!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's weird."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's weird. You know how it feels to be one of the former married?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, but it's not that long ago. See you marry another woman is not really something I look forward to. I just thought if I changed my mind about marriage and children, it was nice knowing you were there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's not it. It's just..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe so. I mean, of course it does. The kind of thing that leaves no one fell swoop. I'm not a guest over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I quit my job."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I return to New York. I thought I wanted this job, but...Getting back to my real life. And you should go back to yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You married. Listen, this is precipitated. It's as if you started a book by the end. You are the most romantic. You stole a blue horn for me. You tried to make rain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was a coincidence. After all this is how your romantic quest comes to an end? You hide in the wedding of another in his house in his life, without thinking twice. This is not the end spectacular than you deserve. It's not Ted Mosby."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You stop it. (Robin drinks the glass of a sudden) My God, so, stop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I spend a very bad day. I've stolen scotch at the duty free. It tells you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have no room. In fact, I thought I could stay with you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And a girl naked, tied to your bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  In addition, Barney."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Great, we'll take five of those."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I'm freaking starving. I just finished a seven-day cleanse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I finished early, OK? (To Wendy) Five of those."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. We always do this. We spend an hour arguing about where to eat, and we end up here anyway. I haven't eaten for two days. Can we please, for the love of God, just order something now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  God."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of course, mine comes last. Go ahead, start without me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And you've had the best burger in New York?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You couldn't find it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where do you think it was?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So I take it you've tried the Corner Bistro."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Green door, red neon sign that says \"Burger?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know that place. I've walked by it a million times. It's on West 12th, right off of 7th."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Finally."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Please, go ahead, start."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Just shut up and eat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I mean, it is just a burger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this isn't just about a burger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What about the underpants?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How big is Marshall's underpants radius?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm not eating that burger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Finally."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't understand. Where is the burger place?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But... food."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They're unopened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They're barbecue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, Ted, Barney has a point. Remember what happened with me and curt down at the station?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  yeah!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, welcome. You look really familiar. Are you a former athlete?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think i've got a little crush on our sports guy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know, i know but he used to play hockey, and i'm canadian. I can't help it. If he were missing some teeth, i probably would have already hit that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And you've got the couples version of the hots for them. Oh, yeah, you want to browse at pottery barn with them. You want to go antiquing with them, don't you? Oh, yeah, you want to antique the crap out of them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, with some sort of catchy name."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bar killer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  yeah, well... I think it'll be okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And it was a huge mistake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You have a butterfly tramp stamp."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  we can split a cab to work together. We always have a standing lunch date. And last night, at the hockey game, Curt got us into the locker room, and i met Mason Raymond. Left wing for the Vancouver canucks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn it you guys, be psyched. Yes, we see each other every day, but i think it's going really well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But it wasn't."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks iron man we'll be right back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So you want to do something later?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are you talking about?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  oh, um, i'm sorry, i-i guess i just forgot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  God, i'm such an idiot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Curt \"the iron man\" irons keeps leaving me love notes on post-its. On the teleprompter, on my desk, on the coffee-maker, on the jar of sugar packets next to the coffee-maker."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The iron man. oh!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wendy the waitress hyphen Stinson."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Curt, we need to talk. I like you..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We're pretending this works, but it doesn't. And i'm getting a little sick of the whole charade."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So maybe we could go back to just being coworkers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And now, here's Curt \"the iron man\" irons with sports. Curt? (he's demoralized) Curt?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, well, their perimeter shooting has been a little bit off this season..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And that's sports."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait a second. You've been sitting here, pretending to be the expert on all this, but the truth is, this was no real fallout from your breakup at all?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're an idiot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did she see your tattoo and assume you were gay?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks for watching."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, God, I have been craving this burger all day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God, I can't wait to see this movie. I hear it's really scary."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They don't know what it is. It just showed up on my mom's X-ray."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why are you wearing that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And nope. I'm sorry, Barney, but no girl is going home with a guy with a flower on his chest. Unless he's a clown, and she's in the trunk of his car."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hmm! Did you know that Barney is French for \"sad little guy who works way too hard to get laid\"\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, on the bright side, I guess suits are pretty boring without them, so..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What, are we gonna duel?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I'd love to. I've got this knot in my neck that's so annoying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, no. Dude, dude. Sweet! It's a kids' show."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, you know what? If you're going to be disgusting, we're not watching this, okay?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, two average Canadian teenagers who solve crimes in space using math."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, guys, come on. It's a kids' show! Like Electric Company or Sesame Street or, um..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Exactly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's just bad camera work, okay? Wayne, our camera guy... he wasn't that great."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what? I feel bad for you Americans, that you can look at this wondrous and educational adventure through space, and see something obscene. Can you just please try to look at this with the innocence of a child?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card from her every year, but we're not really friends anymore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, we did, okay? And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it. I got to go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Just watch it without me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, it's not p0rn, it's a kids' show."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm serious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Our characters had pet beavers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The beaver is the official animal of Canada. It's our national mascot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whoa. He's staying here? You're staying here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied on our couch in the form of your idiot high school friend? Unbelievable!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Don't care."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Get a hotel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, one night. Got to go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, a Korean massage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I figured you'd be busy, reading What to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Lily, what brings you to the crib?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's the matter? You look rattled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It means that a fertilized egg has not yet attached itself to the lining of your uterine wall. You see? I read your Facebook updates. God, it's like it's all you ever talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Great."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, okay? Me first. I've been pulling away from you, and I'm sorry. It's just, the last time my best friend had a baby..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whoa. Look, I hate most babies. But your baby? I'm gonna love that kid so much. I'm gonna pick it up and everything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God. It's the beaver song. Okay, which one of you put this on?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  *Dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah...*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's wrong?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay. Hey, you guys see Deadliest Catch last night?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Pass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, Ted, yesterday at work, I totally talked you up to that super-hot makeup girl, Liz."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, you know, how funny you are..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Handsome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Incredible lover."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I was all like, \"He knows a woman's body better than she knows her own, endless waves of pleasure just cresting and breaking for hours and hours...\" Blah, blah, blah. \"Orgasms so intense that you just black out.\" All that stuff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? You know what you're doing down there. Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it. We know this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe I did oversell you a bit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, Ted? You were worried that I oversold you to Liz. Well, I fixed it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I sent her another email. \"Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound like I was trying to oversell Ted. The truth is, he is a genuinely nice, down to earth guy, and I think you two would really hit it off.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Is he going to rock your world in bed? No. But he's clean, open to criticism, and not into anything too weird. He's not bad at all. Not bad at all.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"I'll be honest. The first few times aren't going to be that great. He's going to say 'Are you finished?' more times than a waiter in a busy restaurant.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why don't I just go to the Chevy Web site and copy down adjectives?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out? \"Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, and really rich, but lacks bladder control.\" Oh, damn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That last bump just made me hit send."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's also quite the detective."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Weird day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, look at that! Liz still wants to meet you. That's great!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe a little."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I did not specify on what scale."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor. Robin? Thanks, Robin, it was awesome. Back to you, Robin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I felt really bad bailing on Ted though."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know who she is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Actually, I kind of was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, after the newscast, I was so excited, I decided to surprise Ted by going to the reception."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dammit. Stop it. What the hell?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just allergies or something. I'm fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, thanks, but I don't actually cry in front of people, or cry at all for that matter. Man, it's gross. Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know, maybe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, look, OK. Yes, I cried in the bathroom, and that was weird. But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy. The fact is I don't know how I feel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy? Lily: Kinda, yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But it doesn't change anything. I still don't wanna get married and he's still... Ted. What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he could be happy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm gonna go find him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have no idea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi, guys,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, I, I have to tell you something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, just get it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks. You're very sweet. So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There's no more milk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  empty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The trash can is full."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I eat cereal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what? Instead of coming with references typical last minute like that, you should spend some time, I dunno... washing a dish."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I always changing. You, never!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I went there yesterday... Stop it! Stop it! My God, what happens? When we were a couple, we lived together and we almost went insane."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what this is? We made love. Men and women need s*x to live together. It resolves all disputes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, of course."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know. It's like riding a bike, man?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sold."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why are you here anyway?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If this is a problem. You've done all the way here to read a magazine? I am willing to bet that there is a place to read this magazine at work. You know, a room with a little man on the door?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Have you thought about maybe not reading a magazine when you read a magazine?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I'm sorry. This is our house now. Marshall, you should also read a magazine. Give me your key."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It seems more important than it is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We will not get there, OK? Nobody will get hurt. It has established rules."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is like telling Fonzie be cool."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can do it watching TV!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  As folding laundry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, not that one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And now they sleep together, we argue more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes. Thank you, Barney. You were right. Peace was established. More than once."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Last night we did when I answered the phone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, it's a private thing between me and Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It is not even discuss it if Marshall could read a magazine at work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Have you booked a hotel room just to read a magazine?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We can make love."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sure, it was a good one. Personal memo: leave it lying around the pizza box more often."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was weird. Bizarre, weird, weird. B-I-R-A-Z-R-E.Bizarre."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, Lily. Do not your Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What do I do?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think we should stop sleeping. Ted and I, it's like cigarettes. You take one into thinking it is good. And very quickly, you buy one carton per week. I must stop it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, you stop that, huh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is for the best. It was fun, but I do not want it becoming weird."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Colocs?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sold."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dude!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Actually, what you did not care for us? I thought you had the perfect plan."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I go step-louse. If you are looking for Ted, he was released. And... our little arrangement is... completed, by the way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Epousvantable?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He insisted. He said \"no longer able to do\" if \"it hurt someone.\" I think we all know who he is talking about."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's not obvious?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes. This is Ted. You know how it romantic. He can not separate the physical emotion. It is kind of..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right. It's not like you, you know? In addition, we are friends. I want to complicate matters by committing. Hanging out with friends never works. So... you want to go eat a taco?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You love them, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, I'm hungry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, um, isn't it a little early in our relationship to do something that would end our relationship?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So... Strip club."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm not cool with it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's disgusting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did one of your whores tell you that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, we're not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did he juggle? Bad puns? Mmm. Expect a standing ovation for picking up a $19 check"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do care, Barney. Look, we're dating now, okay? That changes things. We have to have a serious talk about this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Move. God! (She come over Ted and Barney's table) Hey. 'Sup, dudes? Fries?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No fries for this guy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, about that. Ted, listen. I know myself pretty well. And, some time over the next few months, I'm going to want to sleep with you. And when that happens, you have to try to say no."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, you know, maybe I wasn't clear enough. I will come at you with everything I've got. I will stalk you like the lioness stalks the gazelle: careful, patient, deadly. And if you let your guard down for so much as a second, as sure as you were born, I will hump your brains out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, I'm ready to have s*x now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, we ran out of Cheetos last week. Oh, yeah, it's a Cheeto. Dibs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mmm, totes, toots. She's here on a date. She brought the book because she got here early, and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting. Girls like to come across all classy and smart, you know? (She gets a giant hamburger out of a paper bag)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So you went on one date with one of her friends. It's not necessarily a big deal. I mean, did it end on bad terms?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I guess you just got to move on. I mean, it's not like you have a shot with Ready McGee over there, right? Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're one of those? God, I swear, one in five guys..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They're talking to a guy now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, a cheesy guy. Don't worry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy. Who's feeling nachos?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Jealous?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have not lost it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't have to take this. But I do have to take this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  14 seconds! 14 seconds, and already some dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off. I... still... got... it. All right, buddy, you proved my point. Now scram. Nice belt, by the way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, do I?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Say good-bye before you leave?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Like I said, she's here on a date."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We brought the turkey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What you think you say?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You realize that you will remain one. Are you sure you want to spend a day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I hope Lily is well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're worth it!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do not underestimate. You're a rock star of slaps. Your name should be Eric Baffe-PTON."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's all yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, I will."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I say I'll slap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You said I could slap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, not at all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We have one hour before sunset, and none of us baffera Barney."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I slipped a note of the type 20!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I paid the taxi."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? You said it was fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why did not you say anything?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You really want to slap Barney the point of lying and pretending to be in love with me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This slap is mine, Mosby. I never slap Barney... above the belt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And I would not slap?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My God, you're right. This fruit has changed in immaculate slap-poisoned apple. You know what? Seriously, do it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Baffe-solument."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Leads to me!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's gonna be Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Last year you were abandoned at the altar. You lost your job. You did so along way. I am so proud of you, Ted. You deserve to slap someone in the face as hard as you can."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can not do it. I can not take that away from you, Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, I want to move. Mickey?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm glad you and Lily try to fix things. You want to welcome into our family, I would like to offer you the slap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, man, Ted, this is great."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mary Beth?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How do you guys know each other?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, Derek stood me up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this. You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal. Who works on New Year's Eve? Okay. Now I feel worse. I was really looking forward to this night. This sucks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe I should just go home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi, I'm Robin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're friendly. I haven't eaten dinner yet. Is there anything to eat in this thing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, yes. Ted, you rock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, so much better."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's totally Moby. That's awesome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, that sounds awesome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Moby... the recording artist, Moby."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Is this just 'cause you lost your \"Get Psyched\" mix?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. No, not tonight. Not in the limo. We got to stay psyched. Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's. (singing...) *Shot through the heart And you're to blame, darling*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry about your girl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight. Did you forget about our little deal? Because I did not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Derek. Hi. How's work?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Derek?! Derek."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can't believe you made it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What the hell, man? I thought we had a deal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Eh, he kept me waiting. I can keep him waiting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Happy New Year."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How much did you guys drink last night?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, you just said, \"yeah, no.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, so you're not going home for Thanksgiving."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm Canadian, remember? We celebrate Thanksgiving in October."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You guys are the world's leader in handgun violence, your healthcare system is bankrupt and your country is deeply divided on almost every important issue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, probably hanging out with Barney then?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's awesome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is gonna be great."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is a joke, right? You don't actually volunteer here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? Ted: We're volunteers, we're unpaid help. Can you really ever have enough unpaid help?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, we just wanna help out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yesterday you said the best feeling on earth was getting your toes sucked. Then you requested a high-five with your foot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do charity work all the time. Remember when I said I'd find you a girlfriend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm working on it. I'm gonna introduce you to that girl you've been staring at."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Have you met Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, um, I'm not his girlfriend. I used to be but, um, I just wasn't enough woman for Ted, emotionally or sexually. Oh my God."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, we're in business."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Now, all's right with the world again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Surprisingly good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted. Are you listening? You're a good guy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You said you wanted to see the joy in someone's eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanksgiving in November. Weird."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  To Lily and Marshall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do wish you were a dude."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, and here's why.,Ted, the best man's job is not to crush the floral arrangements. It's to get the groom down the aisle, because, no matter who he is, he will freak out. And I just don't think you have what it takes to get that get that soldier to pick up his rifle and charge up the hill."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And how did that go again? Oh for one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted. (Both yelling) Oh, do you take one to be your lawfully wedded wife? Oh, God, I'm freaking out. Why did I chose Ted to be my best man?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, it turns out that Heads or Tails has a job opening."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So now, because of that incident, Heads or Tails is looking for a new currency rotation specialist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They're not bimbos!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Currency rotation specialist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, it's a national audience! I get to wear shiny dresses!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I am never drinking again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I moved here to work for a big-time cable news channel like World Wide News. Mm-hmm. Well, by this time next year, I will be wearing a World Wide News I.D. badge around my neck. And to show you that I'm serious, this is my first and only drink of the night. Okay. Okay? Oh, damn, that's smooth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I did, but they only offered me a boring, low-paid, off-camera research job."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, so could Heads or Tails. (snorts) The first currency rotation specialist went on to be a semi-finalist on The Bachelor, and then, she lost, like, a hundred pounds on The Biggest Loser, and now she's totally winning Celebrity Rehab."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God! They're really having a baby. What am I doing with my life? Starting Monday, I'm a currency rotation spe... Oh, who am I kidding? I'm a coin flip bimbo, and I'm still single. Okay, let's not go there, Scherbatsky. That's a whole other thing. I've got to take that World Wide News job."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, you are looking at the new associate researcher at World Wide News."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Marshall and Lily. I just realized that I am about to have a little niece who looks up to me. And I don't want to be sad aunt Robin, the aging coin flip bimbo who gives her the creeps. I want to be cool aunt Robin, the respected journalist... (quietly) Who gives her beer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? Oh. I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi, Mr. Trebek. This is Robin Scherbatsky."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  As honored as I am by the offer, um... (Phone chirps) Oh, my God. They're not having a baby. What am I getting all up in my head about? That research job sounds hard. And I'm pretty. I'm really, really pretty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You are looking at the new coin flip bimbo."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, I also said I would never make out with a garbage man. Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. What's with the gingerbread house?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let's hope Santa brings you a girlfriend this year, Teddy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And now she's totally winning Celebrity Rehab."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What am I doing with my life?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Fine, I'll call them tomorrow. I'll call them right now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, that was really cool what you did. When we all needed it, you got us back on the right path."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Ted, if I, um, if I ever get married and you're not the guy I'm marrying..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ...I could really use someone like you. You know, in case I freak out. When I freak out. You interested?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, will you be my best man?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, let's do this!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, this hydro bill is bigger than Louis Cyr's biceps. What, you leave the garburator on all night, eh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, okay. You know what, what does that even prove, okay? You chant anything, people we join in. (Chanting) Canada, Canada, Canada, Cana... Okay, they won't chant anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What Gazzola's?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You guys will not believe this. I've been talking to my lawyer all morning. You know that guy I have a slight disagreement with at the Hoser Hut? He's filing assault charges."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I broke his nose with a chair. And now, apparently, I may end up getting deported."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, there's only one possible way to avoid getting deported. My lawyer said I could become an American citizen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, there's a citizenship test tomorrow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll think about it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, Barney."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How do you know the Canadian test is easy?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  50, one for each state."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The Bill of Rights. Look, Barney, I know all this. I'm ready."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Queen Elizabeth II."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I want to say- Jefferson?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the \"Hey, Vern\" guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all. (She throws one bottle on the floor) Maybe I'll rob a liquor store. Maybe I won't. My choice. Learn English! The Hoser Hut. I could duck in for a drink. No, no, that life's behind me. Forget it. Well, I could in for just one beer. What's the harm in that? It's a free country. (She crosses the road and enter into the bar) *O Canada Our home and native land...* Oh, God, I miss it. *True patriots love...*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney? Oh, my God. What happened last night?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How Canadian?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, God. Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut... And I met this women's curling team."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams\/Rich title double bill in Toronto."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How did you find me, anyway?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Canada isn't across the Atlantic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, I'm not taking the test."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, give me two coffees."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What game?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I guess I missed it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm not American."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, \"Yeah, America's cool.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, \"Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too.\" I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You understand?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"You are so beautiful. \"Why can't you see me? \"Someday, I'll make you see me \"and we'll be together. \"P.S. I love you. \"P.S. I love you. P.S. I love you. \"P.S. I love you. \"P.S. I love you. P.S. I love you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let me guess, (points) Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm a reporter for Metro News 1."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, kind of a reporter. I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news, you know. Like-um-monkey that can play the ukulele. I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, see the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend so tonight every guy is... \"The enemy\"."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She would love that! It does look fun in the movies."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I can't. I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday. Some guys attempting to make a big (cut) so my news is covering it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, he's going to eat it too, it's another record."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (stops) Yeah, (agrees) What the hell (passes number to Ted. Throws drink on Ted's face) JERK! (Walks away. Whispers) that was fun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow that is one bad-ass blue French horn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mhmm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I've got five dogs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I love a scotch that's old enough to order its own scotch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ray, when someone asks you if you're a god you say, \"Yes!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do you want these? (Holding up remaining olives from her plate) I hate olives."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (flirting back) they're all yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I've gotta get one of those blue French horns for over my fireplace. It's gotta be blue, it's gotta be French."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's a smurf pen1s, we're no dice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um, alright. I'll be right there. (To Ted) I'm sorry. I had a really great time tonight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (on TV)...persuaded him to reconsider at which point the man came down off the ledge, giving this bizarre story a happy ending. Reporting from"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (on TV) Metro One News, back to you bill."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I've got five dogs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (from window) Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, Ted. What brings you back to Brooklyn at one in the morning in a-suit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Would you like those olives with some Gin and Vermouth?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  For starters (turns music on. Leaves to the kitchen)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think I like your \"Olive Theory\"."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think I like your nose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You love me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hold on. (Gets up) Wait a minute. (Hands him Olives) Promised you these."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good night, psycho (smiles). (Ted sarcastically clutches heart. Realizes friends left him)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, um-two blocks (comes out) that way (points) and take a right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Everyone thinks they're a good kisser."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good night, Ted. (Shake hands.)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  that's a pretty great hand shake. (Looks him in the eyes)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Captain, quick question: How do you feel about the Jonas Brothers? Ooh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Holding the towel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. Unless you're old friends, which is why I can hang out with Marshall whenever I want. Right, Marsh Madness?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, let's. Let's have dinner together, just the two of us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  December chill... so great."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. Nail-biter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They are fun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Man, this is awkward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Marshall, it's cool. She doesn't see it. What the hell's going on with his eye? Am I supposed to not talk about that? Great, now my right eye is doing it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, so many drinks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, I had this really boring poetry class in college."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?! What? No! No! No, no, no. Marshall, no. No. I... I just saw that board of specials, and I thought, you know what sucks? Being bored. Which I am not. So that clears that... right up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Fine. This night's a little awkward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why is that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, does that mean that I'm a manatee right now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What were those sailors thinking?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  you're afraid that if you spend too much time alone with me, I'll turn into a mermaid?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Am I blushing or...?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, even if that happens, is there any way to un-mermaid me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Pregnancy?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh-oh. I don't feel so good. (She vomits) Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry! Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is nonsense. They are still playing the bagpipes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It does not stop him from screaming to play louder, but it seems that there is rather strong. I have a glass of water in my room that vibrates like Jurassic Park."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why is there a bag of pants marked \"April 2008\" in your closet?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The ties go to the machine?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think that's true."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what? It's true. We tried to find out which of us was most great. But it said draw and we made love. Speaking of that, I am delighted that we go skiing this weekend. I need a break. The upstairs neighbors make me crazy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The ski babes are back!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We spent the weekend hugging the fireside. No black diamonds, nothing but red hearts. I'll unpack my bags."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where is he was not riding? Hey, Barnstormer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nothing. We're just happy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So you talked to the neighbors?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Some old?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So you did what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do not like nicknames."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Seriously, stop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do not like with you either."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Those two worry me, really."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Who, him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How would you know that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's your board that is zero."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can not undress. It's freezing here. I'll be hypothermic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Or just the pants?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They fight because of you!?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The hidden camera in the headboard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney for the millionth time..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was nice to be the ideal couple for one minute."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Stop it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You see? At the moment, how did you do to fix everything?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Calm. Calm down. Seriously, what's the secret?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think we should talk about advantage and get down to business."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's better. It is not the best couple in the world, so what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I never let myself believe this day would really come."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Barney, uh..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, well, what I was saying is..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And Miztva Bar next door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is the guy who convinced you to run around campus naked?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is an annual gala that honors the greatest architects of the city?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If architects had only two bullets, eh Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, to your heart, you know that you love one more than the other.Believe me, takes the other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ok, name one celebrity who will be there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lenny Kravitz will be there?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, Ted, in hindsight, it is too early to choose between these two girls. Takes a friend. Like, I dunno, maybe a friend who has a poster of Lenny Kravitz on his wall, and may or may not have dated this post and transported from his high school..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, that? It's nothing. It cost me three months' rent, and uh, I have never worn because I bought it for a big party to which you would have asked what did not happen. But, you know what? Do not feel guilty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This thing with your uncle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And I forgive you. Now I can have my place and meet Lenny Kravitz?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's for sure!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, what are you doing here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks for taking me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, yes. Where is Lenny Kravitz?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, great. I'll go find one myself and hang myself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's not true."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I say there are plenty of legitimate reasons to fight, it is perhaps not beautiful, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it's true! I love it! I have a culture of hockey. If a guy is a fighter, it is rather sexy. And scars, seriously! If a guy has one, it has a Robin. And if he lost a tooth, I lose my panties."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Just look at that eye. You look like a bad boy. I did not know you had it in me. You. That you had it in you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My God, it's hot!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Tips to captain the football team because he gave you his ring and you were so cute in your evening gown?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney? I was looking for you. I have tickets for the hockey game tonight. It's stupid. Want to go? It can run late, we could go see a drink after."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I forgot! Tonight, it is not possible. I can not go to hockey tonight, I have this... This... This..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, Doug sees someone?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Marshall looks like. He lost weight?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, why you work so hard on this speech? Punchy has applied with a karaoke microphone in a bowling alley."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. Punchy has posted weaknesses of your life?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, he did not need your advice. You never called Nora."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Or you called? It's not that I want to know. So what? I do not care. You did?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Slim, Barney. I was really, really, really for both of you.Who wants chicken wings?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ok, next tour for me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're going to try to make you anybody here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My God, Barney, tonight is a magical night between the annoying friend of Ted and that is what this-face. A little respect."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, you go getting drunk tonight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My God, have you seen this guy. I want Barney is my new boyfriend. No, thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I would like the Spice Girls back together. They were awesome. The worst. (At the bar...) It was me. I farted. It is this type. (At Ted's apartment...) birthday gift from my father. All I want from him is that he tells me he loves me. Just kidding.This pen is sufficient. It's enough. It is completely sufficient."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're more drunk than I thought. I mean, look at this type."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney and I have tried and failed. It was there two years. Why would I start? It would not make sense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? That's why he tries to Lebron anything that moves?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Forget it. There is no chemistry between Barney and me. It's over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why should I tell him about that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well. Barney, just to make things clear..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney... I..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, you said you'd never recalled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  To tell you how I feel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know it did not work the first time..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ... and it makes no sense..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ... but I can not help thinking that goes well together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Is there a part of you that wants to try again?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. And you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not even a little bit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, well, we'll make a deal. You go first and then I still do not tell you what's wrong."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  As in high school. Sorry, I had to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You've been too focused on your work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're Ted Mosby. You do it again to believe it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A chemistry. If there is alchemy, you just need another thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The timing. But the timing is a bitch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm all yours. Unrelated, architects make a lot?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  sh1t."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ok, promise me two things. One, believe in you again, and two, do not cry during the toast, Schmosby."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  For real?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Aw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh please, I'm so sick of the \"meet-market\" scene. Guys are like a subway. You miss one, another one comes along in five minutes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Heyow!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I love Park Slope. When did you move to Manhattan?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (Smiling) Uh, no she is. (Points to Lily)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I'm a ghost! Died fifteen years ago, like that pickup line."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  God, I'm so sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's ridiculous in here, why don't we go somewhere else?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  With your lips and everything...?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ooh, look a booth opened up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I thought we could finally go talk, and you're not listening to me, so I'm going to walk away. (notices Lily is busy staring at a stranger)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (On Phone) Lily's phone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (On Phone) She's uh..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (On Phone) Really? Well I thought it was kinda weird, but if you're cool with it. Yeah. It's off and she's talking to some guy. Do you want me to go over and..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (enters) Lily, I thought tonight was about us hanging out, what are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dude, I think that guy is gay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You wanna be single? (Laughs) You wanna fight off loser guys all night, does that seem like fun to you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And Marshall. Lily, all these girls here tonight are looking to catch what you've already got."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If, by \"Coffee\" you mean \"Cheesecake\", then yes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Then why don't you? You can stay with me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, now I have to wash up for two reasons."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ta-da-da-da-da... Wow, Lily, you look so beautiful."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What happened?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Pay the $300? Lily, are you crazy? This isn't a problem. It's a license to eat. Look, what have you always wanted to eat but didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That is impossible. You ate McDonald's every meal for three days."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, it must be the wedding stress. We just got to up the intake. Lily Aldrin, drop and give me 20 bites of fudge! Okay? Don't nibble at it. Attack it! Come on, Lily. You can do better than that!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, eat faster, before your body figures out it's full."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, are you gonna cry? You gonna cry? Skinny little baby's gonna cry? Well, eat, damn it, eat!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us you don't need alcohol to have fun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let me ask you something Ted. Why are you so much madder at Barney than me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what? I'm not sure that's true. I think I actually prefered if you are mad at me. This is too weird."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, Ted, what else did she said? Did she gave you any kind of explanation?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well that's doesn't seem like that long ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, it'll be pretty hard now that she's dead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. (And hangs up)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Kids, have I ever told you the story of how I met your father?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry, kids."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Insane Duane was your father's best friend, back in the days before he met me or your Uncle Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I knew I could have talked to my friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, kids, I settled in for a Christmas alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dear Diary."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They're trying to make me one of them, Diary."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, hold up, hold up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can't call shotgun for eternity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can't just call things, barney."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, Marshall, he screamed at you, you took it. He probably respects you more for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Is \"boy\" the right word?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Here's what I would do if I were you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi, Arthur."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I got it. Right here. I think it's gonna blow you away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So we good?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Then why are you still in my office?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So it's not a circle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, I was just heading to the bar. What are you guys doing out here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ooh, I like stories. You want a lick? What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, it's delicious enough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh sweet, can I get a toot?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You can't call shotgun for eternity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's case by case."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey. Something kind of cool just happened. My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We prefer Local Area Media Award. Um... there's going to be this big banquet. I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came. And there's an open bar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? It's three months away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So should I wear my hair up or down? Lily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You okay?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were? Is that safe?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted's still coming to this thing, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it's just this guy at the station. I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes. Is it going to be weird?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, um, Ted, this is Sandy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, Mary, what do you do for a living?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, so, Mary the paralegal. What does a paralegal do exactly?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him. Don't let him out of your sight for a minute."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey. Mary seems nice. Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And just like that, it's all okay. Roll credits."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We're still friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks. Oh, wow. This is really a surprise. Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends. They're all here tonight. Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers... Barney... And that's it. Those are all my friends. Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, thanks. Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I put him in a cab."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't date people I work with. I was just trying to make Ted jealous. Is he...?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, well, good for them. And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately? Is he having a nervous breakdown?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Spider! Spider!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, great, I'll see you then. Bye, sweetie. (To Ted) Hey. Guess what? My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend. She gets in on Thursday."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? You'd do that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Falafel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Falafel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I totally choked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So every girl you have s*x with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, here comes Katie."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school, with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, no. No. No. No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's cool. This is my friend Lily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, no, you're not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? Oh. Oh..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's why I need your help."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  See?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh. La, la, la, la, la.La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la, la, la, la."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You smoke now, too?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No \"Aw, remember cloves?\" This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having s*x."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What did you teach?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, that's adorable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, mine was terrible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, as you know, I was 16. And it was with my boyfriend Brian."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Brian."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Eh, I should've known. There were signs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?! Oh, my God!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had s*x, it counts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, it does."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once. You should only be having s*x with someone who's special."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I had different levels of feeling for each of the... very reasonable number of guys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I, um..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Just let me explain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying... \"hm hm hm\" is like... getting into the carpool lane. And I don't want to take an exit, but... at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane. Because what's in the carpool lane? Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. I didn't... Yeah, like you did. I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Pretty sure weird. I mean, who gives it up on the first date?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You... What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can't take it back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place to lecture you on romantic relationships, but... but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's not what I meant. I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up. Please don't do this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She didn't do it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I didn't. You did. She told me that you talked to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Aw, honey. I promise everything is gonna be okay. You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Don't tell Mom."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks for doing that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, come here. I love you. I said it. Feels right. I love you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. I guess I was just waiting for the right guy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, guys. I just got in last night. Um, uh, this is Gael."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's pronounced \"guy-el\"."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I just want to make sure you're okay with this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I just hope Ted's okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And I just want to make sure you're okay with this. (Both laugh) Okay, how do we do this?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, how 'bout if I, um..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If you feel like you need to do that, then..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You shaved."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I like the beard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know it was weird showing up with Gael. I'm sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Over it? My first three days in Argentina, I cried my eyes out. I missed you so much. I wanted to go and prove how adventurous I am, but the truth is, it was really lonely. And that's why Gael happened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I was trying to survive it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's not an Adonis."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's not perfect."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"You're bigger\"."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, Ted... \"you're bigger\"."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All gone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No... Hmm. What could she mean when she says 'no'? I don't know, it is totally cryptic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, Roger Daltrey just rolled over in his grave. That's not the right guy, is it? He's not even dead, is he?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Barney, no, no. We said no fireballs at the table."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There's alcohol in here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know, Barney. I mean, sometimes persistence pays off. I said \"yes\" eventually."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  To Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, I hate to say this, but I think it's \"nail the receptionist\" time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I got it a little bit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How you feeling, Counselor?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello, everyone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do not for me. I do it for the fans."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They are. Put me know. It's been what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, guys. You are four young people active in the most exciting city in the world. And you have nothing to tell me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait. It's really funny?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He forgot his pants. It's pretty funny. Less than a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos. I mean, he... he forgot that he was already one? Moron, the monkey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She came to see you in college and when you had my back turned, she brought the guys in your room?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  As my lunch with Curt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My short-barreled 38 Special Police! I knew that I had left it somewhere. Every time I watch the news, I pray it is not my gun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Who is Nicole Barsamian?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I still lost. You come to believe?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How to say goodbye in these situations? A kiss on the cheek, too familiar. A handshake, too formal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The pants."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What do you mean by linger?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The game is the game"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It happened to us? Where was I?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do not worry. I will say nothing to Marshall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What is the result with the bimbo?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You really do speak of your pants?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Is that all? It's the story?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I am impressed. For you too have worn it all day?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mike? Wake up!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Have you seen my show?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's not serious, but listen to this! After the show..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I just think it will be great both on the air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ok, ok, I'll go on the roof and stay there all alone 5 minutes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, okay, I'll go smoke a cigarette."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, very good, very good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of course."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello, I'm Robin Scherbatsky!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But what was that? Don, you said Pet brain!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, let a good program for what is half drunk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You should know that I tried to contact the town hall so we could get the mayor on the show."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do not know why you act like that. Maybe you've never had a better job offer, but I still can, so I really want to focus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're already past the cable?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  ok, the trick underwear was your choice. And I would not keep that going."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I want to kill him, of course people watching this show.You look at her. My God, you still have not seen the program."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? What color is the decor?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not your TV, the decor of my show. If my best friends do not watch, will watch it..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You have film crews?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey you two, smoking, like us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Guys, I wonder, you also are interviewing the mayor tomorrow, or it just me? Don was in the teeth, while I'm smoking a. Lighter Marshall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Fantastic, I was fed up that you piquiez me my smokes constantly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do not want to have s*x with Marshall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can not stop now, not before the most important interview of my life. It's too stressful."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ok, I stop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why? Because it is important to Don, the issue is important and my career. Not like you, you incompetent. You're boring, you are bad, and I want you to work at least as hard as the elastic of your underwear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No gift, it would become personal if I told you that just because you pass emission issue, it's because you're losing. A loser lazy and obnoxious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello, this is Robin Scherbatsky."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A raccoon has bitten a patient in a nursing home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can be professional?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Marshall?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You watch the show?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh guys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks for calling friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I bought a packet on the way home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He ended up apologizing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We believe in it all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know it's the perfect time there. For one last cigarette. The real last."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ... three."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Coming up next, 'Is your baby trying to kill you?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know, right, isn't that amazing? I spent half an hour making these happen. Its tape in there, cotton balls, half of a Nerf football, but it works, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And old friend from Canada is in town and I'm meeting him for a drink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. Actually, he was my first boyfriend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Simon. I thought he was the coolest guy ever. He smelled like Drakkar. He could ollie on a skateboard. He had the most amazing collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. We spent the whole summer madly in love."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it wasn't like that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I'm sorry, guys. It was all very tame. We only dated for a week and a half."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty much the last week of July. Anyway, one night, his band just finish playing this gig..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God! Simon. That was such a good show. You guys totally rocked out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh... So... I totally... I get it. Pools are great. Swimming's awesome. We have a sprinkler. Run right through it. Well, I should go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, Simon?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I did."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have no idea what you' talking about."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, since you brought it up, let's add up the points."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you. Okay. So, Simon still lives with his mom."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um, he never became a rock star."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He now works at a water slide park outside of Ottawa."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, he's going down. I mean, unless somehow, he got hotter. There he is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Simon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. You look great. You got hotter, like that's possible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So... Look, I know it didn't go as planned, but I can't help it. I mean... he's still got it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So he's not a snob. He's from a different part of Canada, you know? The maple leaf flag on the back of the pickup truck? He's Red Province. He's from the Deep North."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The Foreskins are still playing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know. I'm sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Starred in it is more like it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm sitting next to Simon, and suddenly I'm 16 again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whatever. It's over. I lost. I guess you, uh, you don't get second chance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I got a second chance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He came by my place tonight..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Simon. What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I like where this is going."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'd love to!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That was ten years ago. People evolve. I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That rocked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, uh, sure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, cool. I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, well, you know, it's not a show. It's the news."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And now it's time for \"Puppy Corner,\" some little angels looking for a new home, courtesy of the Midtown Animal Shelter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted. Of course, a lot of the people calling in thought we were going to kill them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, you want the truth? Yeah. I like Simon. I do. We have fun together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're worried? Okay, hold on. Is there any version of this conversation where you guys don't sound like my parents?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's exactly what my mom would say."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is my life! You guys just don't get it! You've never felt the way that I feel!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, like, a billion years ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, we all have. You bought the last round."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else? Tonight, after the show, Simon and I are going all the way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, hey, Simon. Great show. You guys still rock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  God, I just love seeing you so happy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm fine, really."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um, can I make an observation?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, tonight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right. Of course, the-the first being you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, do you want to come back to my place?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, why not?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This was my big artistic follow-up to\"Let's Go to the Mall.\" It kind of tanked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I'm so glad."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, you're right. I was lame."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He was my sidekick. He had to be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Was it really that high?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney's prenup"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The TV happened"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I get... turned on watching myself do the news during s*x."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney's crazy if he thinks it'll work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You have not finished? Why is it so long?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not me. The key? Discard tips and not looking back. I go to Japan. It took me half an hour."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I could take 20 minutes, but a friend called me in tears."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It will not work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, that's exactly the kind of crap to throw away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's like love letters, directories or the ashes of people.They take up space. In addition, she will let you not keep half your mess."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What damage did I do?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Stanley Cup game six? The Rangers will regret having met with the Canucks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're more amazing than a Tim Hortons donut. Timmy Ho!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll give you the teeth of happiness. A little here, a little there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Get out, bouseuse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll break!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm really proud that we have helped Stewart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Dear Marshall, I do not like that stupid hat. I want to cut with a scythe. Or, cut the chisel, for you looks like a real jerk. \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Self Tanner? They entice you with a coupon, and after it becomes addictive."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The magic tricks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Dear Ted, it's encyclo-pe-die, not encyclo-pil-die. Why you always want to say things so pretentious? Looks like a moron, and it's cr-e-tin and non-cr-ay-tin. \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have not written. I am your ex. I told myself that everything I say is offensive. In addition, I am sexier it, so who cares?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And we hope you're not sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Listen up! You sound like that big beta colo. \"Mom, Dad, I want to go. Cool boys play hide and seek with my inhaler. \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can not do that to Lily. Your new apartment a few problems with the floor not right and the sewage treatment plant next door, but you will make a great home. Tell her, Lily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My God, what a band of cowards! Frightened by the slightest change. Terrified by all that is new. Desperate to cling to your comfort zone. I can not go to Japan. What was I thinking? It's so far. I speak the language. I have not even good pictures of you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It is French, it's like playing tennis without a net."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Amazing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wendy, you can take a picture?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney is an intervention."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, get this: Last night, I was watching TV, and it turns out, some random satellite channel picks up a certain local Chicago newscast."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I'll admit, at first, I felt a little weird. But after the initial shock, I realized something: I've moved on. Finished with that. It was a peaceful moment of closure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Excuse me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I don't know what you're talking about."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There's no poop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Okay. So it wasn't entirely a peaceful moment of closure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Don, here's some breaking news: there's a zit breaking ou on your forehead. Finished with that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, I'm not proud, but Don left so quickly that I never got the chance to have that final showdown. So yelling at him, even on TV, felt kind of good. And you know what? Now I truly am over him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn it! Okay, in the process of truly getting over him, I may have called him and left an... indelicate voice mail."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I am gonna kill you. I'm gonna fly to Chicago, kill you, put your stupid face on a deep dish pizza and eat it. And then maybe catch a Bears game. But mostly the killing and eating your face thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Don't worry. I am never doing that again. It was a one-time thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There. Deleted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No? Are you kidding me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Lily!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, no, not this again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, I left Don another message."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"This just in\" is what I'm gonna say when I'm stabbing you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I tried to. But then this thing popped up on my phone that said, \"Are you sure?\" And I wasn't sure. I can't lie to my phone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's not that easy, okay? You're not just deleting a number, you're deleting a part of your life. You know, all those memories, all those experiences. It's like you're admitting they're gone forever."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, if it's that easy, I'm gonna delete one of your numbers from your phone, see how you like it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Super Kicks Karate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You have a dojo?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How long ago did you take that class?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How do you even remember that? Lily, this is a number that you will never dial again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, no. But you keep it in your phone because it reminds you of a version of yourself that you could be, even if it's a version of yourself that you'll never become. And that's okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  For the last time, I don't care how big it was, it is not the same as giving birth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And the intense eye contact thing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And the thing where he establishs intimacy through physical contact?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So at any point in this did you say, \"Barney, I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. I am not taking that job\"?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Teddy, you are so going to spread your legs and design that building."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, everyone thinks it's so easy. Give me your phone. Let's delete one of yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Edwin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You guys played one gig four years ago. I'm deleting it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  See, it's hard to hit that delete button, isn't it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry, Marshall. But if I have to, you have to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, guys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How do you do that? You are like a bomb-sniffing dog, except with poop. You are a poop-sniffing dog."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Fine. I called Don again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Don! It's Robin again. Look, I am sorry for all the calls. It's just, I saw you on the news, and it made me a little crazy for a minute. I guess I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought. But I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to kill you. No... No, I'm not. I am happy for you. And that Asian slut on your Facebook page. She's dead, too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I did, but it turns out, I memorized it. You can't delete contacts from your brain, Lily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I am never going to have closure. Okay? Closure doesn't exist. Okay, one day, Don and I are moving in together, and the next thing I know, he's on a plane to Chicago. It just... ended. And no matter how much I try to forget that it happened, it will have never not happened. Don and I will always be a loose end. We'll always be..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Who is this?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry. Is this 917-456... I'm sorry, 465... No, wait."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry. Wrong number. Finished with that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He speaks to p0rn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I wanted to go to a concert. Him at a party. We could obviously do what the other wanted, so we stayed to watch a movie on cable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Shut up..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Shut up..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Shut up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Shut up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay. Decides that the piece."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Face."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You do not have the right to do this to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  From this! That's what I mean. How does it feel in my champagne?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Please, shut up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I thought you had mentioned, sorry. (The waiter brings them two glasses of champagne) This is an engagement ring?Are you...?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We're committed to one another."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Easier for taxes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Scherbatsky\" is hard to spell."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I guess."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not so loud, sh1t."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You will be my bridesmaid?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You do not know any that girl over there?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're not a bit old for that stupid doll?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He wears a diaper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A stormtrooper? Rather a storm-merdeur."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It looks like your storm-merdeur the changes we need."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I said nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know Neil Young is my favorite musician."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Neil Young is a Canadian treasure. Do not make fun of Neil Young."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was broken."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look at us. It is horrible all the time like that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are we doing wrong? We love. If it does not work, what then? We are so similar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That might be it. There may be too great there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Me too. We separate?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's maybe not a break. This is perhaps... two friends... who find themselves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's a stormtrooper?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  In addition, Alan."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  One for the Road?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I am already involved with Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I think. It may take a while to recover, but... You had a thrill?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It is getting it soon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi, guys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It gets worse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No! Ugh! And I can't believe it's my first day, and already I'm the girl who slept with the host of the show."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, now that I know it's Sandy, I'm not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I wish I was the office slut."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And we can explore how those policy changes will affect Iraq."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We did not have s*x."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know, maybe because I'm a smart, talented, professional."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We did have s*x."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But this reporter takes pride in..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And now everyone calls me Scherpoopie. It's not funny."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But I thought you talk to your dad about everything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And the fertilizer is seeping into the ground water, causing..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, yes, I, uh, I fell into some manure. It's hilarious, fine. In a five-year career of on-air reports, there are bound to be a few embarrassing moments."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, but in my case, it was just the one, and you found it, so, uh... Just the one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Everything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  *Everybody, come and play*... I'm a dirty, dirty girl... *Throw every last care away; Let's go to the mall today; Today, today*...

{"prompt":"","completion":"  They even found the video of me getting attacked by an owl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I did not get attacked by an owl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, don't you dare tell me to steer into the skid, okay? It's too late. I'm already wrapped around a hydro pole. It's a Canadian telephone pole. I never should have taken this job."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Who?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, God. Tell me you didn't go over there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, God. Tell me those aren't the names of your fists."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God. This is..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If people found out Sandy wears a toupee..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, no. He's very open about that. That's Gregory. Nice guy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Actually, it was a good day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Actually, Sandy, I have something I think you're all gonna want to see."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, I didn't do it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I didn't want to just viciously attack someone out of the blue like some kind of..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Exactly. So, instead of taking your advice, I took your advice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, it seems that Marshall has to work late on Friday.You know what that means, party girls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's just that... I have never heard of this before Jillian, and suddenly, it's your best friend. You do not stop talking about her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, but Marshall is still there. There was not much time to talk, just us two."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is where the story gets really good. So it goes..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ... place. And then this... guy talking about this thing with the stuff of which I spoke the other day about this place.Well, anyway... it happened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I wish we had time for girls. I love Marshall, but I am not free to express myself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, but I want to stay too late because... (Marshall and Ted joined them at the table) Do you remember... this thing last month after going there? You know who said it was going, but she gave me tips."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's great!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Your friend has a birthday here? She has what, 19?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was not like a Woo. Perhaps it is that holidays like Mardi Gras and the day of the year. Maybe this is a cyclical Woo."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, Jillian, it seems that when you not flash the bartenders, you are mistress of CE1. How is it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's been what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Given that, do Woo?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have not done Woo."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's not true."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's just... You're married, I'm still single. Whenever I'm with you, I'm usually the 3rd wheel. Sometimes it's nice to go out with other singles and doing stuff you do not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  As to Woo, Lily. As to Woo."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's not true."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's not you, that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Someone won a trip buttocks until the first dance floor of the canyon of spanking!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's what the fireman's helmet?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? Who sings that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, it does not work. You should not be there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  On the contrary. Why do you think the Woo Woos have to when they win a drinking game? Or when a guy takes off his gun t-shirt? Because that's all that life brings. These are...People really sad. And when she go out with someone who has it all, someone like you, it's disappointing. It takes them Woo."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look at those girls. Look at them and listen to what they mean Woo."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right now I am like them. I have no job, no boyfriend, I'm confused. So... occasionally, I need to Woo, but when I need to talk about something concrete, it is to you I turn. You're my best friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Or a stove in your bathroom?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh! You know what? I bet sleeping at this angle is good for you. For some reason."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh. Other cultures!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'd offer her my place, but I've got dogs and she's allergic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery, but it's gotta have a couch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on. She's desperate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Absolutely not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, the Popover Pantry! That place is great. Can we go get brunch tomorrow?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh,really? Who's this friend?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Girly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ooh, third date. You know what that means."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sounds like Brad's got quite the night planned out. You better bring your \"A\" game. That means no granny panties."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, it could have been worse. It could have fallen in your lap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Just keep Brad away from the bouquet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And now you have to do what every dysfunctional couple has to do: Break up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily can know nothing of what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really?! It's great, I love this stuff. Guys why this kid staring at me? I understand, I think it happens at last. I recognized my show."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I go on TV."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We're friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's how it goes boy, every relationship has a low and high."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's why Lily is not jealous. The strongest is never jealous because where could go lower? The fort, Lily, is the best thing that low, Marshall may have hoped."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, it's definitely, you are going to buy a horse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Try your luck."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I've realized that you forgot something this morning, so I thought I would bring thee: thy pen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nothing to Ted, your course was on my way to work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, stand New York."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really, you watch my show? You flatter me see. Other fans here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That night, great show on poisons. (She goes out, then reopens the door) Also, who makes the worst pizza in New York, I will give you information on traffic streets 5 and 9."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's good but um, this was not your first spelling bee, does not it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh that's good. But hmm. But um..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, I have a great idea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If you want to make one of your classes exciting, I could read it from someone a little more fun, your students can pay attention and learn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, just because your class prefers me to you..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But umm?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm not But um, I never told But hum."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, your third book is your new novel, but um..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  sh1t! Sorry. But, but just. No hum! Your first book was written more quickly?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But umm..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I wanted to ask about the novel you're writing right now, but um..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And tonight, you had to, but um..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  For a long time, but um..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ok, um... but thank you for coming but um... If there are students who look, but um, but um, but um..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The police officer was unharmed but um..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How's you all?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I just wanted to tell you go... (She takes a megaphone) To all those watching. Go! Standing New York! BUT HUM!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The dialogues seem pompous old now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What was that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You made a noise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not that. You made the sound of the naked girl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  When you see a naked girl, you make noise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is Holly who writes to you? You're not promised to wait three days?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, just try to proclaim your sound of the naked girl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whatever it is, I guarantee you she do not wear it. She lies to please you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Because no woman in history has never, \"asked to read architectural magazines in my old... uniform cheerleader. \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Baby, I got to eat at Generro. I come home soon. \"Yes, it sounds bad, but thinking a little. It is perhaps for his brother or father who is ill."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"And then I want to... you to take me on the couch.\"Maybe not a sick father. Father or a really sick... Right? Sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi guys! What is it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bizarre. Holly sent a message to Ted talking about a meal Generro. A second. Band of bastards!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You did this all day? This is wicked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I was a single case. This is not Holly Robin Scherbatsky. What is wrong with her hair? News Flash: detangling, it exists for not having a helmet. I'm so mean."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And he really knows not what means MDR."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Super Stan. Who is it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That guy you fell in love. I hope his girlfriend is not jealous. He spoke of a friend or...?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's okay. It's over now. I have to leave, but that's what happens: you call it now, tell him what you did and apologize.Got it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? How she explained the scope of texting?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Marsha and Billy. They are not trampled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You cling to Barney and Marshall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They did not believe that you'd wait three days, so Barney has changed his number by that of his work laptop.Holly is Barney and Marshall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think they have done that. They were just at the bar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, it was them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know. You should tell them that you are not fooled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I see. Why not: \"I have told anyone yet, but I only have three months to live\"?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I love this thing someone said about three months to live."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's good, but I think it comes down to trick the three months to live."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So what? So Ted has gay dreams about one of you. It's not as if he had three months to live. It would... Shocking, no?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know their names?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it's Marshall. Married to Lily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, guys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy boy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, at least you apologized. You apologized, didn't you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses? If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're sick."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're sick."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You sure this is gonna work?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Totally. Plus free mug."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney! What the hell are you doing? Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Eww. No. You have to go home and get to bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She's just mad. She'll cool down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where are you going?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You just look like a regular guy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And isn't it more comfy?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, you need eat something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Fine, I'll feed you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, you're not having ice cream for dinner just 'cause you're sick."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, do you want me to go with you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  First tell me your answer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You mean the whiney bottomless pit of neediness? He was bugging me, so I spiked his echinacea tea with codeine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm gonna help lily pee."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, uh, that reminds me, I invited Bob."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, he didn't have anywhere else to go, and I didn't know what to say. Is it really that big a deal?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry,sometimes I forget how seriously you guys take American Thanksgiving. Real thanksgiving happened over a month ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find the northwest passage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, there's Bob! By the way, heads up, he's a little bit older than us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's forty-one. Hey, bob! Over here!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let's go get a drink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, they just called. They're both super swamped preparing for tomorrow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, he went to see green day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Making pies."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, they do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You, too. Is lily in the kitchen?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Great."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I yawned like a million times trying to get him to leave."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I kept looking at the clock and sighing... totally clueless."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And then Ted does the thing that he always does when there's an awkward silence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He panics and says the first thing that pops into his head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, did you know that the first pies in recorded history came from Ancient Egypt?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'd already broken the ice with my cool pie fact. then he makes it ten times more awkward."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did you know that the egyptian pyramids can be seen from space? Probably?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, um... the pecan pie is gonna take the longest. Why don't we put that one in first?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um, it's my favorite."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know. I just like smelling it. It's like eating with your nose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I-I just thought it might upset you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know. Is it so ridiculous to think that you might be?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's 41! Why are you bashing on him so hard?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's mean."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  First of all, Bob and I are not sleeping together. We're just dating. Secondly, have I said one word about the parade of dubious conquests you've been marching past me the last few months? One of whom got you a butterfly tattoo?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And if you and I are such good friends... why is baking a pie for Bob so weird?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, what are we doing? It's Thanksgiving."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry, too. Of course we're friends. I'm glad we're friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You are correct, Sir."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That is a truth-fact."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  kablammo."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Lily, it's not as bad as it sounds. Bob and I aren't that serious, and what happened last night with Ted was a fluke."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I hear something burning..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Clearly, we need to talk about this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We need to talk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We need to talk about last night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, can we please just deal with this? Look, I'm not mad. I just think..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?! you're crazy!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Only because your hand was still around my waist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I... leaned into it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, that was you in little league, wasn't it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look at us! We can't be alone together, can we?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What does that mean? We're supposed to be friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, maybe we should stop pretending."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So... what do we do now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I guess we're not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's the general idea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Just 10,000 glasses. No matter how long it takes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Put it!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ask your weapons!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think I am more than qualified for the job. My weaknesses? I would say too caring, overworked, and I spend my career first. Oops! The latter is true. What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The bathroom is. (His phone rings) You know what, I will respond."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can not tell you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How do you say? I entered and he was naked. It was funny. I laughed, he laughed. And then it happened. I know not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have not slept with Mitch because he was naked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Because... It... It... because I like Mitch. Much. There was a... connection specificity. Specificity and feelings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, that, \"the kiss for a roof.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do not. My roommate in college did."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  s*x, \"He says he loves you, but do not want to say the same.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have not slept with Mitch because he was naked!Mitch and I have something special. My fingers are crossed.That may be correct."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're makeup?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's a pleasure to see you again. I really enjoyed it last night. So how does it feel to hold a Pizza Hut? Who had the idea to put a pineapple in the..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? It's crazy. Usually, you see clearly in my game, but there you are mistaken."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have not hated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? Of course I do! I did not sleep with you just because you were naked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, his name is Mitch. And... this is my boyfriend. So..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay you can go. It's over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  First-class tickets, a four-star hotel--"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did you show lily your design?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, guys. What's going on?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why? Was he being mean?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I gave them to you for your birthday."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney! Oh, my god!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know, um, like the Loch Ness Monster."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, that's the stuff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My Dad taught me to shoot when I was a kid. Now, whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here and it reminds me that... guns are fun!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  Marshall!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Marshall, you can't do that!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I didn't say a thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I didn't say a thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, tough love, not hand the guy a noose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I'm a gun enthusiast."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The Second Amendment protects my right to bear arms..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A little."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Is there a hot tube at your uncle's place?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted. Ted you should see this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I wish I knew you guys back then. You know why? Because you can't kick a story in the nuts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not bad."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I'm sure they don't remember. I mean, it's been like 30 years since that completely made-up story didn't happen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I didn't realize you were small potatoes. And to be clear, I am referring to your testicles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You want to dance? Let's dance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Get... your other hand... off my ass."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  (laughs) Ted's something else."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Comes on a little strong."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, totally. I mean, he's sweet, he's charming, he's just looking for something a little bit more serious than I am. I mean the most I can handle right now is something casual. This just stays between us, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (on TV) Thanks Bill, I'm reporting from the Razzle Dazzle Supermarket on 75th in Columbus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  where four year old, Leroy Ellensburg, climbed inside a grab a prize machine (You see child stuck in toy machine) and gotten stuck."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why? They will do anything q'ils learn that I am..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bemidji. Bemidji, Minnesota. Go Vikes!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So my father and I were in the NFC championship game by 99."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And when we missed the penalty and lost..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Holy sh1t! f*cking. My father that I had never seen him cry in my life, wiped away a tear and said, \"A small part of me just died, son. \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's what I tell my son. If I am fortunate to have a son, I will call Rashad Tarkenton."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know! They all bought into."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You think I'm trying to steal your bar? Host."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What was that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  As fear of the dark?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is stupid. Why do you think Canadians are afraid of the dark?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, wait. I have something to say. Everyone. Let me tell you something about Canadians."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why Canadians are not of birthday wishes? Because they are too afraid to put out the candles. My God, I love this place!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, but I can catch a fish and use this one to catch the other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Rashad Tarkenton."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what? I'm glad you know it because I am proud to be Canadian. It was not a good NFL team or Prince, but we invented Trivial Pursuit. Anything, the Earth! In addition, in Canada, you can go to a strip club full of alcohol and order. And yeah. Moosejaw in the Bay of Fundy, you can whistle your pint of Pilsner while watching a minor girl to get naked. Jealous? In Canada, people do not care where you come from, as you are whisked away nice and possibly a cigarette, or when a donut. I am proud to come from the \"Great White North\"... and I want to be right now. And was not afraid of the dark. Finally, we do not really like, but like everyone else."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry. That was your cue. I should not have my own.But every year during the holidays, I am homesick. And so far, every year, I had a reason to stay: a boyfriend, a job or something. But... This year, for the first time, I have nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I miss sometimes. I wish I could close my eyes and find myself one hour in Canada."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How did you find this place?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There's only one way to know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's OK."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's like home."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did you show lily your design?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, guys. What's going on?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why? Was he being mean?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I gave them to you for your birthday."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney! Oh, my god!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Incredible!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bizarre. A Barney Brown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  True. The blonde does not go to any guy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It would not look good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of course... the chemical stuff, yes. But, what grows in nature, they can try, like, a couple of times."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think that we should not lie to kids, Moo-Moo!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I've tried drugs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What was that for?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I see..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The executive producer of WNKW saw our show the other morning and I loved it. They offer me the position of presenter, starting next week."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, but here's the thing... WNKW is..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Is Chicago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why it happens now? While all was well with Don. This is the never ending battle of my life: career vs. love."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm lost. What do I do?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm too upset to talk with him. I have to avoid the time I decide what I want."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You did a manicure?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It gets no compliments."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It may be that I moved to Chicago next week."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It failed him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He had a manicure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I had a job offer in Chicago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Actually, I already made my decision. Friends, I must accept."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So I was on the phone with Chicago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, I made my decision. I appreciate the offer, but I can not accept it. Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm staying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello Moo-Moo! Monty did you do an extra-fine pizza just as you love them! Are you okay?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You said what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm going."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can. Good luck in Chicago, Don."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Say yes to that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can re-move? (Ted takes her in his arms. They sit on the couch) Is I'm the biggest idiot in the world?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Seems like I become more and more stupid."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do not care."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It looks like Barney."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, the celebrities, they like really weird s*x stuff. Believe me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's embarrassing, but I... I came home one evening with a celebrity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He wanted to do weird things with me, so I left. That's it.End of story."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not you, Barney."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll tell you anything specific. But all I will say is that he is Canadian, but you know it. And he brought home by offering to show me a single collection."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  As you collect stamps or coins. But I say nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know not what you call it, but we have a name for it in Canada. Listen, I've already said too much."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll tell you. But only if you correctly guess the three parties."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, the only thing that carries the woman is skates with his hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's like the Moustache of Chicago, but the person below wearing a combi."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I dunno, I want to know. These people are crazy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, but I say only if you find the person, the act and the collection."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. I would have accepted it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  For me, it's called a..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You really want to know?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But this info does not leave the table."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is not the person is the sexual act. It's like the Sacramento Turtleneck, but with maple syrup."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it's the collection. Harvey trays. These orange trays they give you when you eat at Harvey. Restaurants? Will you take a trip on the Trans-Canada Highway, you have a hollow between Milverton and Wawa, where you stop eating, eh? At Harvey. More than 12,000 customers!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The Frozen Snowshoe. Oh, my God! You know Racket jelly? This is the most famous pro wrestler of Canada. I met him after his victory over Rick \"The Daredevil\" at the Rogers Memorial Arena in Kamloops in 2002. A classic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right. And I'm serious, do not tell anyone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's very impressive, The Frozen Snowshoe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So... Snowshoeing Would you like me... Old King Clancy one?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  - No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  - You have a brother?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? I never in a million years would I picture you with a gay brother, that's awesome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks for the heads up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How in God's name did it never come up that Barney has a gay, black brother?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  - Hey. It's so nice to meet you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, I have to ask, there's a story here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bras suck. They're so confining and unnatural."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whatever, you guys have no idea what it's like to be on the receiving end."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. There's no way. He's Barney's brother."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And, Barney... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... he's texting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. You actually do, don't you? You're not checking out my boobs or anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I love this place! Let's dance!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  - Whoo! Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How's it going, guys? Still enjoying the attentions of men?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, me, too. I'm not tired at all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, sure. Anything you want."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's not work!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know you're nervous, but we must stop procrastinating. You've spent two days to choose the pen official Mosbius Designs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Who are you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's going on?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're right next door!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So now Ted is assisted to do nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, the guide."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This table just told me that you're an idiot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This idea of being a guide is to procrastinate the fact of calling customers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, but PJ does not help."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  At noon, when you go to any walk of reflection, that leaves us time to spend together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Tell me, PJ, I have a question for you architecture.Ted's ass what taste?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's locked?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Listen, PJ. And I want you to think seriously before answering. You tell me I can not go to the bathroom with me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why does it excite me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  When I leave the job, it is 5:30 am. Got an idea of guys I meet?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, you get up very early to discuss the European market? How is it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What productivity? You did not call a single customer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Seminar?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is our apartment. You let a cake on the counter, Mama's going to offer a slice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  One more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll miss you too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It is driving me crazy. When PJ was working, he was sexy. The keeper of the key toilet. A sexy guy that says when you can go to the bathroom or not? It's the dream."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have to stop, right? I know not break."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Listen... Dude, I know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, it's just... It's not really... that, you know?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I feel it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But friends and others."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If this is what you want, I totally understand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are you kidding?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I took the key to the toilet without asking. Are you gonna do?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are you okay?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No one goes to the library, so you do not care of this type. And you must pick up the phone and call customers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You wanna talk drop? I described as the perfect guy \"funny, intelligent, passionate, ambitious.\" And apparently, I just... \"In my apartment.\" You thought that you would have understood, now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can do it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It looks good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Now known as a real customer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I hate my job."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mayor McWouaf. It teaches the children clean, dressed dog. Finally, it is supposed to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The table! There was a table... Back. (The cameraman has fun throwing papers) were returned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I understand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A single interview proper, it would be nice for a change."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, you've nabbed seven peanuts in a row. Impressive but not enough to be published."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's the thing with which you played the other day?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ten seconds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, sweetie. I have a trick to help you sleep. (She pulls out his gun) Glue this under your pillow. You'll sleep like a f*cking baby."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's going to hurt someone. There is the... security."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe there should be a pause.."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? They caught him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, where did they find?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I've seen. That's why I take the taxi."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's happening?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, Barney. I know that Marshall has not been mugged by a monkey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No one wants to see a guy who comes to play with dolls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, your dolls are favorites of Rhinebeck prices next month."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Because the FBI wanted to be occupied while they searched his home. Come on, Marshall. I need history. It has everything. Crime, monkeys, no stupid model of the Empire State Building, which takes me all my living room and smelly glue everywhere. Go. Do this for me... As a friend?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Who knows someone who has been mugged by a monkey?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The best is that it is possible that the story goes on national TV. Guys, this story of the monkey attacker can make me famous."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do not be nervous. We will sit down... It's that thing, whore?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Surprise. We thought it would help to bring you to confront your abuser."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  In your own words, describe what happened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We talk about that. We speak your aggression."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We come back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Great, tell it to America. Five minutes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, tell us the truth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  sh1t. Okay, put a microphone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, what do you say after three decades of not seeing each other?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, to be fair, everyone has some glaring gap in knowledge, something really obvious you somehow never learned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? I seem to recall..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, that wasn't easy. It took a lot of \"ch-aracter\" to admit that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You want to tussle? Let's tussle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Please, no."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Seriously? The North Pole? Okay, pal, if you want to break up with me, just tell it to me straight. Don't pretend you're going someplace we all know doesn't exist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of who? Santa's elves? Rudolph? You know what? I'm going on a trip, too, Scott. It, uh, starts in Narnia. It works its way up to Candyland, and then, hey, congratulate me, because I'm the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Expelliarmus!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So... you want to get pizza later? Or..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I still think about him in the shower."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You've hurt me before, why should I trust you now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God. Barney's dad."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are you sure it's not more than that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, I'm not an idiot. Reindeer are obviously f... re... fake?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's not true."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Righteous hair tab, brotha."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ooh, ooh, I got one. You think John Kennedy and Jack Kennedy are the same person. (laughs) Right? What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You consistently miss at least one belt loop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Coming up at 11:00: Are there piranhas in the East River? What you don't know... could eat you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's okay. They're my friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God, that is so fantastic! I don't know if I can just leave work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let's go to Atlantic City!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Don't worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, really? Thanks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Done. (She leaves)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Does it smell like strippers in here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen. Here, it looks like everyone brought their own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, up here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You were just staring at my shirt boobs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really?!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? Here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Something is seriously wrong with you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, let's do it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, I'll leave it on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, let me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nobody's gonna do that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sweetie, this is crazy. You're never gonna find a ship capt..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do you think he's winning?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I never said \"never.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Backgammon, obviously."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm going to go get another round."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, sure. She's great. Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted? No. Victoria's great. She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great. I said, \"She's great\" too many times, didn't I?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Prude alert."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, slut alert!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, where have you been?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She never showed?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Fine. I'll go next."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I was doing a report on live TV about a hansom cab driver."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The whole time?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  When?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello? Is someone out there?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You re-returned for me. That's really sweet. Though you kind of ruined my customized Scherbotsky doormat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Oh. Translation: booty-call."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Guys booty-call girls after 2:00 a.m. with a drunkenly slurred, \"What ya doing?\" But when a lady booty-calls a guy, she invents a respectable excuse to mask the fact that she wants to get stuck real good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   That's not a thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Please say \"widows.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Barney, Desperation Day assumes that all single women freak out about Valentine's Day. Which we do not. Case in point, I will be spending February 13 with some lovely single ladies from work..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  ...who could care less about Valentine's Day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   And we will be celebrating the fact that we don't have to spend it with some dippy guy carting around roses and stuffed toys all night. Oh, no offense, Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Hey. How was \"baking cookies\" last night?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   So how did Zoey react?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Were there slippers for the morning?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Yeah, if you say so, yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Look, she just got out of a marriage, Ted. That's heavy. I'm kind of freaking out, just listening to you. My heart is pounding, I'm hearing this weird clicking noise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   See, that just amps up the pressure even more. Boy, it's a good thing that you're sure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and everything is pink and red, so Bev very thoughtfully suggested that we wear purple to show how little we care."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   And we don't care about some stupid, sexist, corporate holiday."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna beat him in an arm wrestle?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Oh, yeah, I agreed to that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Well..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   What...? So that's it? A couple of white Urkels offer you sausages, and you're gone? What about the sisterhood? Solidarity? The color purple?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   I thought we didn't care about Valentine's Day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Oh, hey, Nora."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Check."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, \"who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And I just slept with my ex-boyfriend's really good friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, here's the deal, Barney. The second my feet touch the ground, this never happened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Now we go back to exactly the way things were before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, Barney?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm gonna shower... till June, and, um, since you were never here to begin with, you won't be here when I get out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, you are."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm gonna get a drink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What is?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What thing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Ted. You ready to, um... Where'd the goat turd come from?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, it was either that, or a musk ox turd, and I figured,what the hell would a musk ox be doing in here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney told you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Marshall, you can't look me in the eye, you're blushing, coughing, and your hands are shaking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted is never finding out about this, you understand? Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything. And don't even think about opening that can until I'm out of the splash zone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's up?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  From my vacacation in Vermont."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I slept with Barney!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was just one time, it, it was the night that Simon dumped me and I was in a really vulnerable place and I, I wanted to just pretend like it never happened, but I couldn't, and... I can't. I just, I had to tell you. And... I just hope that we can still be friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So you're not mad?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, Lily, that may seem like a good idea after a couple of drinks but tomorrow morning you're going to want this thing out of your house."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Marshall!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? I... Lily, I really don't want to talk about this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily,come on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The other week, Barney made a move, but I turned him down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey there, Scherbats, your voice of reason here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nice shirt!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney's offering me fifty bucks to say some stupid word on a live news report."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But I'm not doing it, I am a journalist."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  For your information, my boss is about to bump me up to the City Hall beat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So I'm not going to jeopardize my promotion by saying \"Booger\" for fifty bucks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Who's Natalie?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well why'd you guys break up?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You wanted to see me, Mr. Adams?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  City Hall? (Pans In) Oh, my god."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, next time you're passing City Hall, make sure and stop by New York's oldest hotdog cart.

{"prompt":"","completion":"  What a jerk!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A little cutesy."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  We need to talk. I just think, um, we both could use some space right now. It's not you, it's me. I know this hurts but you deserve someone better. I'm just really trying to focus on my career right now, you know. I just hope we can still be friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What the hell was that? Doug: That was my new mommy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, this picture is not of me?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, that's it, huh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, there's always a 'but'."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, guys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I told you-- Randy. He was a machine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Fine. I didn't sleep with anyone. The thing is, ever since Becky did that commercial, everyone at work loves her. So, the day after Halloween, I was in a commercial."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm going to the bathroom right now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Say... \"Ah...\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, hopefully you never will. They said that they might not even use it."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  They need a finger to do what I think."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's almost 2am. I must work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's been almost a month. I'm used to. And then the show is not bad, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You've ever watched?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Your favorite item?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Have you ever looked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know, this is basic and bland, and it is smaller audiences than the Korean channel that does that Kim Jong Il by the horse. But, friends, it would touch me to know that at least once you look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're the best."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello, New York. I'm Robin..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You have not seen the show?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The routine."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  And you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I would surely be in Argentina."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Or Tokyo, or Paris."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My God."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, without you we would come out still together?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do not say that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Soot, breadcrumbs, placenta. You have not even registered?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, it's over?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  beef pie, macaroni and cheese, butter cookie house."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Basically, Lily made us break."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If it had not been there, we always go out together?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We should make a pact. If the years pass and only 40 years old, one is always alone..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A girl dreams of hearing those words. A million times, yes!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Genre?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Just one thing: no nightgown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait. While no one wants to see a, uh, coyote wearing a little hard hat more than me, remember: Zoey's protest could still shut your whole project down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, Marshall's helping you save The Arcadian, now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That bitch is not giving us the walk-by."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, Lily, I think this girl wants our seats. Should we leave... or stay here Lionel Richie style \"All Night Long\"?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ejected!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Carl! Oh... This has nothing to do with us. You're totally ridiculous. (The girls stand up and leave the booth; the other girl sits down at their booth) Don't look, baby. Just don't look. Come on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Man, what are we going to do without her?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, you know what, these guys are not going to get all mushy sober. We need to get these bitches drunk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I don't know. Red wine has kind of an odd effect on Barney. He reaches a point of sad clarity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If we want them to open up, I say we go straight-up gin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Absolutely not. I'm not going anywhere near you and a martini."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Every time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh-huh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We're a dream a baby's having. We're a dream a baby's having."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It happened, and it changed me. How about daiquiris?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. Peppermint schnapps turns Barney into Richard Dawson."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The crazy old host of Family Feud, who greeted women by kissing them on the mouth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, enjoy Martha's Vineyard. Hopefully by the time you get back, we'll be allowed back into MacLaren's."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Stop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, they're not talking. They're not even looking at each other. That reminds me of those awkward Sunday dinners with my mom, my dad and his mistress. Families, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, now we need to get them something that will make them emotionally vulnerable and completely, pathetically honest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. That got real o'clock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dance, my puppets, dance!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, God, totally!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sharing a brandy. Which is what I walked in on my parents doing once. Brandy was my father's mistress. God, parents. Right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? What is it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, what drink finally did the trick?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Morning. Who wants breakfast?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn it, I know what happened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, what drink can fix this?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I got it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All-Nighter?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's cute."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did you just need to get out. Take a walk. Pay yourself a bagel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Take an umbrella. It's going to rain, according Galoshes, our clown-weather."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And this restaurant that you draw, what form it, Hoss?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Eunice is itself these handbags. They are hand-embroidered silks at best. And each takes months to do. I can not say how long... (Robin threw in a bag) Weather, fools!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  On the other hand, I bought a big bag today."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You want to know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm pregnant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Stop! I'm not pregnant. This is an intoxication. I ate something at the restaurant, three hours later, I vomited like a fountain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is a disgusting issue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I want to tell you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Someone has already put on YouTube?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I'm pregnant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You adore this place. If I tell you, it will ruin it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I say nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I say nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You really want to know? This is Schlegel's Bagels."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You have noted Gaby Allan dual, 78 and 162."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, looking at the names on this list, I do not see a lot of ethnic diversity. It should really be questioned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I hate to tell you this, but..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You did the right Gaby Allan counted 2 times, but...you're also spent 138 to 138. Have you used the same number twice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's enough tables."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Alright, see you guys later."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Your hair is adorable!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You've gotta hear this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You go first."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily is back in town."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, yeah. I actually went apartment hunting with her today."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're not gonna like it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, I am so happy for you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You never chose sides. I respect that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted found a penny on the subway and it's old and that's interesting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, we don't. He's just starting to get better. Going out with Barney. How do you think he'll feel when he hears Lily's moved on?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, it happens. I've fallen out of love faster than that before. Sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever. One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me. But we're great! Honey?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, you just want Lily to be miserable. The truth is she's happy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Trust me, I'm a girl!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why do you always have to bring that up?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You bring it up every time..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dammit! OK, so how do we get the truth out of her?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, Lily you're crying over the crown moulding and the real hardwood floor. There's no deeper meaning, right Lily? Just quit crying and tell him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'd take you with gravy if my boyfriend wasn't sitting right here! Just kidding. I'm good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't think so! Whoo!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But it's good, I mean work's great..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have a message from Barney."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I have that, too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, here's the message. (clears throat, then reads Barney's note) \"Oh, hey, guys. Didn't see you there. I was too busy feelin' fine and...\" Really? \"Feelin' fine and gettin' some 'jine. You may have noticed the giant plate of hot wings in front of me. I know how much you love hot wings. Too bad someone bribed the kitchen to take them off the menu tonight. So, if you want some, you're going to have to come back to GNB. But hurry, this offer will be gone lickety-split. (Barney licks his hot wings peace by peace then throws them down) Do evil laugh.\" Oh, um... (makes a poor impression of Barney's laugh) So, what are you turds up to?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um... thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I-I don't understand. Why would he fire you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, Ted, can you just please think about this before you..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, Ted... you know I love Zoey. But, look, sometimes... I go play chess in the park. And the key to chess... Okay, I play online. But the key to chess... Okay, it's Angry Birds! But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The chairman asks you..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You say..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And Zoey dumps you on the spot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There's the second scenario."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The chairman asks you..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You say..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And you're happy for, like, a second, until you realize the building you helped save has just become a monument to everything this woman made you give up, and you resent her for it, so much so, in fact, that you dump her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The chairman asks you..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But before you can answer...You're hit in the neck with a blow dart fired by the ninja Zoey's ex-husband hired to assassinate you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That one's less likely. What I'm saying... what I hate saying... is this. You and Zoey are gonna break up. But you can still save your career and Barney's."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's really the only sensible idea right now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ho! You're judged by a jury of your beers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, cute dog!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks for stopping by. I hacked the thermostat for 1 h before it was seen that the intercom."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The theft of Lily's tonight, you're really not looking for it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Knowing your wife, she'll still bring you back a pack."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I always find it silly. What happened to \"when you grow up, the relationship matures with us\"?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why make a fuss a little ritual is abandoned."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do not wanna hear about f*ck like rabbits."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How dare you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All of these little rituals, nice, cute... This is stupid. Say what we ate? They look like kids playing in the dinette."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? Okay... Robot mode station-you-on-the-aisle-in-waiting-for-excuse-of-the imbecile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You think being in love, it's just to have pet names. Or let the words stupid or darken in the blizzard for no reason."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what you are? You're a snob of love. There's lots of ways to live a relationship, you would know if you left your little club \"Snob love.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nothing to be done. I will not sit here and insult me.We're not going to the airport. We go. (The snowplow passes and buried under the snow) It's been what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Close your eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do it. (Robin opened the roof and the snow falls on them) Now, go find your wife."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Seattle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  His flight was canceled. He has never taken off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I still think it's stupid."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I've not dredged."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ugh! God, this is, like, the fifteenth time my dad has sent me a friend request."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh my God, that does describe a vampire, or you know, a bartender."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I should go get dressed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, I told you not to call him that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's not a billionaire. He's a hundred millionaire. Why do people always round up?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A charity dinner."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  $1500, Stop rounding up. And it's for third world hunger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I'm gonna be late. You guys have fun. Bye."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh hi Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi Ted. Sounds like you're having fun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Listen, Ted, I can't really talk right... '93? Dude, that's impressive."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's sweet and odd. But I'm kinda on a date right now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bye Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello again, Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, for the last time, stop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, it's Robin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, I think you and I should have a talk about those phone calls last night. Do you mind if I swing by?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey guys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No kidding. Those calls were really weird. Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That goes on for three-and a half minutes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, you can't do this. Please, we're to be friends and now you're making it all confusing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really, you moved on?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, you were with someone last night? Ted: Yeah, Trudy, she's cool."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi Trudy, I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you. You're right, she is shy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Then why did you hide her from me? Ted: Wow, you're good. Did anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 Minutes?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, you did, last night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Get some sleep, Ted. You had a long night. And don't feel bad, I've woken up with worse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I was there for the \"insertion.\" He used shoehorns. I'll be having sides."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey! Morning, Blitz!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, none of us meant for it to happen, but, well, we had an awesome night with her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The oven."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think the smaller turkey just tried to crawl further inside the bigger turkey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, you violated a dead turkey with another dead turkey. Don't let that be in vain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike and he sang \"Twist and Shout!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. You sent a wang out, and you got a wang back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I meant the wang."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, let's get an outside opinion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Dear Wang Guy...Can enemies ever be friends? Just wondering.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's bold and uninhibited, so why not? And guys, you know what? For fun, why don't we ask him what he does for a living? Wouldn't that be fun? Just ask..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? No. Shut up. I hate him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What does that have to do with anything?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know. It looks pumped. An old cop associated with a young and rebellious. It reminds you of anything? Mackleroy and LaFleur. Do not tell me you have never seen Mackleroy and LaFleur. This is the best action movie of all time Canadian. Mackleroy is a young Mountie whose horse is killed by evil Americans, and LaFleur, his old partner grumpy and Afro-Canadian, just buy a nice fishing shack in northern Alberta..."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  There is no futon."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm too old for this stuff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There's a side admirable in its way to remain young.Who wants to be old?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" ... soon..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Your ear begins to feel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay. It's good. You have your own list."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A list of things that you are too young. Do all these things and tell me if you still want to be old."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  An agreement of honor!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay. I call it. But it is 4:30 am. It will not be awakened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have not called yet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  As a manager, I threw in the towel. This bet is over.Your ear looks like a Danish pastry in a French breakfast."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The Russian beer? I will take a bierofski. Bierofski. Got it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Totally lady bone killer, but not an eight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You don't seem to care what's going on in our lives unless it's an eight or higher."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's there in the box? What there was in the boiiite?What there was in the boiiiiiite?! What there was in the boiiiiiiite?! Not bad eh? Nothing. I'm the idiot huh? What there was in the box?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's happening? What is this window?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My cats."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, you were really a virgin before he met Lily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I went out with this guy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You do not give a lecture tonight?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Likewise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Your challenge not interest me but you're cheating. Wear a suit under the overalls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh it does not tell you goodnight, he tells you how he feeds his horses. I could sit there and tell jokes Farmer on you all night. Challenge accepted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was a big tractor 3-axis."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Relax, everything is under control."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know a little something about loving to men... you see me as one of those magnets that can not put a picture of your children on the fridge.

{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, well... hello you!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Funny? I think it's hilarious. In fact, I liked so much that I think I'm pissed."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bourre."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was not me!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are you crying?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not as much as me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  $ 500? No worries."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, Barney. You've been crying about this guy or what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I made a mistake in letting you go, right? Your pen1s is huge."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, good, good news is that the inspector has killed some cockroaches at the time of impact."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, I thought you said that a cougar could not be more than 50 years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was our turn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey.What's with the blackboard?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait. You go to the hardware store to pick up girls?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of course there are."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're going blind, and you're trying to soak up all the beauty in the world before the darkness descends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up. I mean, any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney and do this or that, or this and that, or do this with those in that... I mean, she should have known what she was getting into."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's fake proposal girl. I mean, she hired a wedding planner!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, she only bought him a one-way ticket!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn it!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Jorge Posada!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're kidding me!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, you're the tiebreaker."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh! I can't decide. It could be any one of them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, here's how it's gonna work. Now, Lily..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ...she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And then I'll come in, looking hot as all hell."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Get your hand off my thigh, Barney."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, if you don't, I will."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's funny, I didn't even \"look\" in the mirror today. That's not anything, is it? So, I made a reservation at San Marino tonight for 8:00."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I'm kind of tired."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Robin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, if you don't, I will."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But this is the first time she's meeting me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But I don't want to get married and have kids. What am I supposed to say?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm gonna lie."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, boy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm just not ready."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh. Uh, I thought you, um... It's great."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, absolutely. Whew, what a relief it is to know I'm the one girlfriend your mom doesn't want you to have kids with."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl would pop out attractive children? 'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry, that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, if she's so sweet, maybe she should have Ted's babies."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nothing. (She leaves the table to go to the bathroom, the door is locked, she knocks.)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why don't you want me to have your grandkids?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No! I mean, I don't know. I just... I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids. And you should. I'm a genetic gold mine. No family history of diabetes or heart disease. Everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight. I had one schizophrenic uncle but even he had perfect vision. Which was unfortunate for the people around the bell tower he was in, but still he was a very fine man, and..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why do you say that? I mean, you got married pretty young. That wasn't a mistake. Was it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't care how unpleasant it is, you have to talk to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, if you don't, I will."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mrs. Mosby?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They love me!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, we're back live in 30 seconds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Aw, man! Why?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay is Lame? I thought Lame was a gay bar. Or is that Wrong?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I like Focus. Let's go there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not Where. Focus."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, Closed is closed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ew, Third Base is all frat guys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God, my secret crush is here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, my secret crush. We met a few years ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh... no. (laughs) The only good thing about how ugly that shirt is, is that it distracts from how terribly it fits you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh. (Laughs)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I had to leave before we could finish talking, so that was it. You know, ever since then, I've always... Oh, my God, he's coming over here. Oh. Hello."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I'm sorry, you must have me confused with the shirt you were wearing that day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mm-hmm. You, too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, how is that awesome?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, Jerry's gone; Let's break up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, that guy who came over here who thinks we're dating, I kind of have a crush on him. Can you help me clear it up?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A four? God, you are, like, the worst judge of guys ever. Okay, if he is a four, what are you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're a doofus and a half."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  At a close-out sale at Dawes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Ted. Oh, no."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Just take off your damn shirt. Okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right. Whoa, stop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Stop. Perfect."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. Yeah, just like that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, somebody had to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, hey! Thank you so much. We're super excited. We're thinking June. (laughs) Yeah, okay. Okay, jerk, do you remember how you ended up buying those red cowboy boots?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So get off the field at the Superdome, because you ain't no saint."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I, uh... Oh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, it's okay. I guess it just wasn't meant to be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know. Good night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How about Mimi's?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We did?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Because it wasn't me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I've never seen Van Helsing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My boss just got back from Maui. He said it was really romantic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  When were you in Maui?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  With my sister. Why do you always say that? Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people. It's silly to try to act like we didn't."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Totally."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't want to hear that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  God, that is so insensitive."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're a jerk!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mm, we should get down to the bar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn, my face is so dry. Is there any moisturizer around here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist... face lotion..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, this is great stuff. Now I know the secret to your great complexion."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it's not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, in other words, some girl you went out with."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why is that still in your apartment?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not three dollars! Try 14."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town. It sounds like a whore to me. What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. No! No! Oh, Ted!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Question? Ain't no question, girl. Obviously, he's got to get rid of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So we agreed that we would let you guys decide."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, that's adorable, but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Your mom's creepy and gross."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on. It's not gonna be that bad."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, \"Now we are really cookin'!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was pretty bad, though."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God, you've been robbed!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All that stuff was from old girlfriends? Don't you buy anything for yourself?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have s*x with you when I'm really tired."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nope. Well, except for my dogs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's your point, Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's ridiculous."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But not living things."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Things with a heartbeat can stay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Pickles, go get your ball. Go get your ball."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um, no."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So we're-we're okay?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, he really is. It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs. Might be time to send them to the farm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No! No, no, no, there really is a farm. My aunt has a farm upstate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. I could visit them on weekends. My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"They\"? What do you mean by \"they\"?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I gave my dogs away to my aunt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but... I think it's for the best."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Can we go inside?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why? What's going on inside?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You said you threw all that stuff away!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We're really doing this?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And the Captain wasn't glaring at you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Then, after I saved you from destroying"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How long have you had her... slash him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, how nice of them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's the 100K fiasco?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life, but it's really mostly machine at this point."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, don't. Be strong. Do not go all \"prisoner's dilemma\" on me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But Thai food, Lily. Pad Yum Mao. Tom Kai Gah. Thai See Ran."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, it's gonna be fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Shut up! Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking. Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage. Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts-- the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up. Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai. You mentioned cigars."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hand me those chopsticks. Hey, how about some tunes? Oh, great song."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. This was a terrible idea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It looked like fun when she did it. So I wanted to try."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How are you going to get everything done?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll go with you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. I never got to go to my prom. We always had field hockey nationals in the spring."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The cough is supposed to cover the \"lesbian.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in. We don't want to mess things up for Lily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay? Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I never thought this would be a bad thing, but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. I've never been to prom before, okay?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Is this gonna work?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  For free."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, what the hell? It's prom. That tastes like cough syrup."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nerds who aren't good at math? Life's going to be rough, boys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My phlegm feels looser."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music for \"Good Feeling\" and bring it out here, like, now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me. I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive. Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's, it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, sheet music's on the way. Are you okay?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, we did promise them one dance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Sean, look, um, you're a nice guy, but I just don't... No, you're not getting lucky tonight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me. I'm going to ask you something and, um, maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever. But, um, are you having second thoughts?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world. I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint. And as far as your lesbian experience... Happy?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Shut up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You tell me. I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me, there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, I've missed you. Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way, not even in an I-forgive-you way. Just in a I've-missed-you way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Say you're my bitch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Because tonight, I am getting us all into \"Okay\"."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, well the owner goes to my gym. It turns out that he is a fan of my reporting for Metro News One. So now, I'm on the list for tonight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's even getting me into the VIP room."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, what does \"VIP\" stand for in your universe?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Alright, so you guys are in. Should I invite Marshall and Lily?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Got it. Anyway, Ted, part two of my story: my friend Kelly's going to be there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, you are gonna love Kelly. She's fun, she's smart, she lives in the moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, and she's totally hot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, Kelly works with the news breakers..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (Shows up) My bitches! Check this out. (To Doorman) They're with me. (Doorman allows them in)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, she's around somewhere. Let's go find her, I'll introduce you guys. Then I should probably dock into the VIP room, so stupid and arbitrary isn't it, who get's to be in VIP and who doesn't?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's... not that arbitrary..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (Subtitle) There's Kelly. (Leads them through the crowd)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (To VIP room doorman. Subtitle) Robin Scherbastky? (Door man shakes head) Robin Scherbatsky! (Doorman refuses. Robin walks away)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm calling the owner, there's a guy in there who won't let me in to the stupid VIP room. What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Great, voicemail."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bye."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (On Phone) And it's not that I care so much about getting into the VIP room, I have been in tons of VIP rooms, not exactly a VIP room virgin. (You see doormen changing shifts) Seriously, call me back. (Turns around to doorman #2) Oh, um... I was just in there. Robin Scherbatsky, I'm on the list."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But, I'm Robin Scherbatsky. I'm a reporter for channel one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Actually, I can't even get myself in. I was such a dork. I get recognized one time and I start thinking I'm Julia Roberts. No VIP. I'm not even an IP. I'm just a lonely little P sitting out here in the gutter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I hate to take his side... but come one a wine tasting? What's the big plan for next Saturday, scrabble night?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why are you becoming this person? I heard that in college you flashed a campus tour group on a dare."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um, pause... you can go wherever you want. I guess the question is where do you want to go?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well that you can't do. (Silence)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good news: I don't have to cover the cat show tomorrow night. Who's up for hanging out?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, nine years? Your relationship's a fourth grader. Congrats."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Actually, I was talking to my martini."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey? What's taking so long? I have to go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped. She really needs some support... or a stranger's tongue down her throat. That seems healthy. All right. Guess I'm in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know... I was this close to being a huge slut."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have s*x to get pregnant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I believe it... this is awesome!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank me later. Let's keep moving. These little bastards are everywhere."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But I..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  See you on the other side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's a woman."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let's just focus on your target."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I got this one. Oh, my God. I love your jeans."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, no. I am all about the dudes. Although pickings are pretty slim tonight. Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, jeans will only get you so far. I'm going home with him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What happened?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But why?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I didn't say I liked Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're not gonna tell him, are you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A-7."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of course."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Post rap? On which it would work?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can see the mini pig?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She gave you her hook."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It gives you false hope, but it does not engage with you, but it keeps you in the corner, just in case, like... an old canned chili in the pantry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do you feel pretty good. It is gone. It was on both sides. I was hooked and crocheter. It's good guys. I was shameless, but I did not have money problems."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Right now\" is the catch phrase of choice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're always on the hook."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And let me guess: it's not gone further than that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are you kidding? And this daughter of the university library? Henrietta?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It is too much to your hook."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You like to have Henrietta close for the same reason that Tiffany likes to have you close, it flatters the ego."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mike and I are just friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If you mean to do my laundry, I'm starting lineup."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What! I do not keep Mike in my hook."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dude, I'm a girl. Our female parts are like a cobweb.Sometimes you jokes of things you want to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And Henrietta, in any way, are not losing time with you, huh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There is no one. Just the girl with whom you came out recently."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're a little dramatic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What did you do?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry, big guy. Honesty is hard, but ultimately it is the softer alternative. (Mike enters with the laundry basket) I must tell you something. You've finished the laundry fragile?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It can wait."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How are you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why change your mind?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know, it could be cool. I've never seen Woody Allen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have seen plenty of other famous people. Last week I saw... Maury Povich."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I am, too, a real New Yorker."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have been here for almost six years. It's not like I just got off a boat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Those rules are all stupid, okay? I've never done any of those things."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, come on, if we jump in a cab, we'll be there in 15 minutes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Is anyone else suddenly craving green eggs and ham?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ooh, taxi!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Excuse me, I've got a thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Gregor's Steakhouse, downtown."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi, Becky. My, you're perky."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Keep it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, is this ride your way of apologizing for this morning?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are you kidding me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Barney, can I talk to you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, well, this... This is something important. Um, I'm having a... A really rough time at work. You know, the whole Becky thing..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes. Look, I've spent the last,six years in this city, focusing on my career, all for nothing. Some lady almost got me killed. Maury Povich stole my cab. I swear, this city is starting to reject me like a bad organ transplant. You know, everyone keeps saying that I'm not a real New Yorker. Well, maybe I should just stop trying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it's my fault for thinking that you might care. Ranjit, stop the car."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Seriously, stop the car."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Carrots and peas."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can't believe it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, God. Oh, bite me!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. I am done with this city. It wins. I just want to move somewhere new and start over."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What did he say?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey! Lily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where are Marshall and lily?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I won? I won!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can't believe I won!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I won!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So I said, \"the cab, of course\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait a minute. So, where is Woody Allen?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn it, Max. That's Maury Povich."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, they're the best part."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is going faster than I thought. We'll make an appearance at the bar for the wake, we'll be watching the game by 8:00."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, I have to be at work exactly one Super Bowl from now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, I'll take that action. Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand. Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings? Oh, commercials! Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But unfortunately, the City won't be fixing the unusually large pothole any time soon, so buckle up if you're on the BQE. It's gonna be a bumpy one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it's not. It's time for Weather."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, weather's pretty fickle, it may have changed. What's it doing out there, Lou?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No! Let's go to Traffic Todd in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I haven't watched the game yet. I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl. I mean, change the teleprompter. No team names, nothing specific."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My friend Mark passed away this week."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's just so hard."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And after the Super Bowl, the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up, sending the mayor of the winning team's city 15 pounds of a delicacy his of her city is famous for. Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And let's end the day on a happy note. There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo. Trish Sanchez has the story."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No...!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mission accomplished."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Way to blow it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Beer still works."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I almost got fired today."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, sometimes, the guy with thick glasses and a t-shirt of the Smurfs, it's just a cliche. And sometimes it is a moron with a squint and a platonic relationship with Gargamel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Guys, when Dale called for a second hot date, what do I tell her?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How cute, Marshall. But I think mom knows when she was a hit. I mean, he could not help but look at me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You asked him if she had reached the right exit?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is a lucky girl, Barney was my best shot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of course I do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's happening guys?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  As in, a toothbrush? You use both?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, look, Barney has yet fallen one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, Ted, we know tons of people who call Jen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, you're there. The dreaded call from Dale. Oh, that's my mother. She has big health problems. But why does he not call?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No! Shut up! You have not a kind of toothbrush to share or something like that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait. Are you saying that for 8 years, you have shared a toothbrush every 3?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm having so much!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Poor guy. It must pinball."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Jen Coulin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why do you..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It scales all his education in the toilet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's only been five days, he will call!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Tell Dale not like that, ok? It is twice as good as you never will!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Forget not you bring your toothbrush."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? Why? Because the guy with the weird cut went back?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm still not."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, if one of the Vancouver Canucks came here, I fall on my ass so that there would be a hole halfway to China in the soil."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Barney's done."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I met my soul mate, and he never called back. Well, not yet. He will. He will."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, they and Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, sh1t."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's great, I'm all baseball. Mookie Wilson, while a player eh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I live just above."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And Miztva Bar next door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is the guy who convinced you to run around campus naked?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is an annual gala that honors the greatest architects of the city?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If architects had only two bullets, eh Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, to your heart, you know that you love one more than the other.Believe me, takes the other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ok, name one celebrity who will be there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lenny Kravitz will be there?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, Ted, in hindsight, it is too early to choose between these two girls. Takes a friend. Like, I dunno, maybe a friend who has a poster of Lenny Kravitz on his wall, and may or may not have dated this post and transported from his high school..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, that? It's nothing. It cost me three months' rent, and uh, I have never worn because I bought it for a big party to which you would have asked what did not happen. But, you know what? Do not feel guilty."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This thing with your uncle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And I forgive you. Now I can have my place and meet Lenny Kravitz?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's for sure!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, what are you doing here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks for taking me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, yes. Where is Lenny Kravitz?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, great. I'll go find one myself and hang myself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Angela."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mona?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, what are you gonna do?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing. Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Vicki, um... I'm so sorry about this, but there's been some budget cuts and, um, we have to let you go. I mean, after tonight. I still need my makeup for the broadcast. So... (Robin on TV wearing a lot of make-up.): Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What is that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, you didn't fire him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And, uh... I... got you a rose."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, wow, a new dart."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Nude art."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I'll go out with you. Bye, guys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why it's almost that guys?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We'd better find a new bar."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Abbreviates!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's not so sexy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. Shut up!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You see? Marshall does not think she's sexy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The second sexiest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Is that all? Come on, you're always in costume."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We know you're gonna say \"costumes\"."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, your date with Cindy?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, Ted, she's right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Finally, you can abandon the quest for so-called sexy barmaid."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You two, the fact that it is not real sexy! She is sexy thanks to circumstances! Look."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Carl, listening. No. I do not want to leave. Mercy, mercy, do not force me to leave."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I was someone there, behind! Everybody loved me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What would you choose: a million girls and one three parts?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There is one thing that's been going on. Uh, it's about Ted... and Zoey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I thought the oven was Celsius."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, it's good. You see, after that night, none of us heard from Zoey for a while."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Finally, Ted called her up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She is a lovely person... warm, intelligent, just kind of gullible. It's like, every word out of her mouth makes you want to be like, \"Oh, honey.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know. You just want to wrap her up in a blanket and give her a cup of tea. She's, like, this little lost lamb who needs to be protected from the wolves. Speaking of whom..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So the night went on, and eventually everyone went home, except for Ted and Honey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And Barney."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good for you. Ted Mosby does not take advantage of poor, helpless honeys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hmm?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hmm?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Funny you should say that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Isn't that a little harsh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now, too. It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her. She'll always be around."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, just shut it down. Okay, just ignore your feelings. If-If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self. Look, I like Zoey. Without her, my dinner party wouldn't have been such a success. So those feelings of yours... shut 'em down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So don't answer it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You just went through a tragedy. It's not like she's gonna call you up and..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Just don't answer it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Marshall, you can beat this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You don't have to answer. You can just let it ring."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can do this. I believe in you. Don't do it, Marshall!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, there is something to that. I remember thinking my tenth grade math teacher was very sexy. I wonder if Harold's still in jail. What? Tax evasion. Among other things."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, sure. Why not?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um, sure, why not?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Brutal."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And they were so nervous, that they weren't even making sense half of the time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, how'd you know?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  P.S., not sitting great."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Show him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, tough luck, every Saturday night I've ever had, 'cause this one just blew you out of the water."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, we'll call you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, that's what you say at the end of a crappy date."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Who was that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my god! You're right! He's totally the sexless innkeeper!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Which is funny, because usually it's the innkeeper who offers turndown service. Oh!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We have. Go on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, you guys were serious about that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No...Lily..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're right."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All that sexlessness has made you wise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey. We wanted to say we're sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait. We just want..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, it's just... We haven't seen you guys all week."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, it sounds like this is getting pretty serious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Pfft, who needs 'em?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi. Two for dinner."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  After midnight? No way. We can't tabooty-call them, it's pathetic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  For charades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You don't."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, you ready for brunch with Lily and Marshall?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, come on. We bust on each other. We're just at that place in our strong friendship."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Get off me. Oh, see? I did it again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I saw a couple up front that were nice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And cake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  s*x. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This b*st*rd's kicked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A cat person. Why am I not surprised?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ugly, ugly, ugly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know what you mean."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, no way... you're the coolest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, I am."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, you look incredible."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, here's hoping he cheats on you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, guys, for the last time, this place is enormous--"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Boyfriend. Barney Stinson is my boyfriend. I've said it, like, a hundred times it still sounds weird to say."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know. I think Barney's been single for too long."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Like, the other night, I wake up at 4:00 a.m"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, are you awake? Barney?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney. This is not a one-night stand. We're dating. Come back to bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's happened three times."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And it's not just that, it's other things."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (crying) It was just one thing after another at work today, and then... (sniffling) I found out my aunt's in the hospital. I'm just, I'm feeling so overwhelmed and it's just..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, thanks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, I'm not the touchy-feely-est person in the world, but... a little more effort would be nice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I understand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, that's not it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe he just doesn't have it in him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe is whole thing's a big mistake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's cheating on me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why else would he buy me flowers? He's gettin' some on the side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Plus, he keeps saying he's working late. But when I call his office, they say he left hours ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes. Proof. Go word. I'm glad you brought that up. Barney's briefcase. He forgot it here this morning. (taking Barney's briefcase)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We, we-- you and I-- are going to open it up and look for evidence. Ted probably has a sledgehammer around here somewhere."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There's a basement storage area?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What the hell is that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (slowly) Barrel resin?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So you need a hand throwing it out?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, um, what are you gonna do with Mabel?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, hmm, let me think. Do I know any rodeo clowns? Oh, that's weird, I do. But even Lenny wouldn't go near that mess."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, let's just hope they're not allergic to barrel sin like Lily here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. I'll grab my coat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oops."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God, he's cheating on me with some college girl. I knew there was a skank but I thought she'd at least be dumb.(reading the notebook) \"Birthday: July 23.Favorite hockey team: the Vancouver Canucks. Age: 29, but tells people that she's 26.\" Oh, my God,these are notes about me. Or some 29-year-old version of me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why would Barney have a notebook full of information about me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why is Ted teaching a class about me? It all started a few weeks ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, guys. What you talking about?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Top Ten Robin Scherbatsky Facial Expressions and Their Meaning.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Defusing the bomb\"? What does that even mean?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Distract\" me? Oh, that is so condescending. These guys are really starting to piss me off!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?! That's not distracting. That's just talking about the story of a scrappy little underdog team that prevailed despite very shaky goal ending and, frankly, the declining skills of Trevor Linden."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You have to clean your gun. My uncle had a filthy old shotgun, blew both his thumbs off trying to shoot a beaver. You want to distract someone, make them watch my uncle try to eat corn on the cob."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did you know that before intercourse, the male and female emperor penguins bow to each other? Mr. Penguin (bowing). Mrs. Penguin (boxing). Oh, God, silly penguins, acting all fancy. ( she laugs) What were we talking about?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted's only teaching Barney horrible things about me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ah, well, too bad it's next to a page entitled..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (closing the book) Okay, can I just say that my deepest need in life not to have my father to say, \"I am proud of you, eh?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm not crying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, stop it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait a second. It says here that the class meets at 6:15 on Tuesday."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's right now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I have one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What the hell do you two think you're doing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dude, it's a barrel!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have so many questions. Why would you do this? What were you thinking? Who the hell is that guy? (showing a guy in the classroom)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Auditing\"?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait. You did role-playing exercises where I was played by Shin-Ya?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, I can't believe you, Ted. You actually think you're some kind of an expert on me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, half the stuff in this notebook is patently wrong."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Robin Scherbatsky's Surprising Erogenous Zones\"? Let me clear something up for you, Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   (embarassed) Oh. Yeah..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, uh, no. Um, the right one's ticklish, I guess. But the left one, yeah, I'm glad you're back there. Because that is just some sweet, sweet lovin'."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We had just started dating. I was being nice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (to Barney) And you. You know, I got it into my head this week that you were cheating on me. I even broke open your briefcase to look for evidence."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, in a way, I was right. You cheated. You can't get some crib sheet on dating me. That's not how it works. If we didn't figure out how to be with each other in a real, honest way, I don't see the point of even trying."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What do you want?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I guess I'm impressed by how much you remembered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, since you know me pretty well... am I fooling myself with this whole Barney thing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're an idiot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That notebook, um, does contain a lot of personal info, and I think it has my home address."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks for lending me these boots. Where did you get them from?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've begun a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That is so fascinating. So what happened?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, gosh, separating conjoined twins. That must be the most amazing feeling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That is so funny. You are so funny."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bring me a razor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They've been surgically removed by Dr. Awesome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, please, he's really cute and I really like him. And he's got a British accent."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, I have pounded three cappuccinos waiting for you. Pretty soon I won't have to shave, the hair is going to vibrate off my legs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, he can't see my legs like this. I look like a Turkish lesbian"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There is a pharmacy across the street. Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where's the shaving cream?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies room. I've got TB...tiny bladder. I'll meet you out front?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You've gotta be kidding me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Excuse me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm here, I'm fine, my head is bleeding. Going down again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"This long-distance thing sucks, huh? And I really need to talk to you tonight.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She's not going to break up with you, Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do you want to come over?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sit. Good boys. Okay, remember, stay out of the liquor cabinet. I'll see you tonight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And so the life of a television reporter is very rewarding, and I stronly urge you to consider it as a career. Thank you. Yeah?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, no, I don't have a fiancé."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, actually, I've got five dogs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I've got five dogs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, yeah, that's cats. I'm not some pathetic cat lady. Not that your grandmother is..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Does anyone else have a...? Yes?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. Are you? Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ha-ha. Laugh now, those kids are monsters. They're going to eat you alive."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm flattered you think we have two viewers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, and why does this keep coming up today?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? Oh, no, that was Ted. He's just a friend. I mean, there was this moment where we almost dated, but we want completely different things. Anyway, now he has this girlfriend in Germany and he thinks she's calling to dump him tonight, but I don't think she is. And besides, we want completely different things."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, moving past the horrifying image of your hair helmet clanging against the headboard, don't get involved with people I work with."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, guys. Miss me? I missed you, too. Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over? Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do you want to come over?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like, \"You know who likes juice? Ted.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Great. So you want to come over and make juice?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, we'll juice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay... bye."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Or we could just drink wine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore or what the hell you're doing with your life? Do you ever have one of those days?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know, it was just a, a rough day and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you. So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Am I? No I'm not. I'm a news anchor. Smiling's a part of the job. Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today. See? You're smiling, too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, yeah. Do you like it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. Weird."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll be here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good night, Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, my God. We're making out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is crazy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay. Bye. (She hungs up) I thought it was mine, so I answered it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, whatever you do, do not name your baby \"Becky,\" right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Becky. My new co-anchor? Don't you guys ever watch the show?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Peace talks in the region have been described as, \"productive.\" Becky?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Becky, we're-we're journalists. We can't get emotional about the news, we..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, if you read the story, we might find out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, uh, let me get this straight. So, in, uh, in this scenario, because you make such sweet love to Lily, she is now your daughter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Members of the G-8 convened today in Vienna to discuss plans to fight climate change by re... What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Becky, Becky, this is our news segment, okay? Nobody cares what you did yesterday."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mike!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, back to the G-8 conference. Hello? Mike, can I get in the shot? Fantastic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Wait-- did you go out with Ted Mosby?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In other news, later today, a Manhattan architect gets punched in the throat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, of all the women in New York, you had to go out with an eight-year-old girl?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, you know that I hate her. How could you go out on a date with this girl?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let me guess: she acted like a helpless little girl, and you stepped in as the big, strong man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait. Is that why you slept on the couch last night?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, we don't care about this..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, but you find it irresistible when Becky does? I don't get it. The Ted that I went out with was attracted to the kind of woman who could use a steak knife without supervision."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Needed? (scoffs) She makes training wheels feel needed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  When we were dating, I... I didn't make you feel needed?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I got this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I got this. Whoa!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I got this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did that really bother you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I got this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey. Um, when we were dating, did... did I make you feel needed?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks, Barney. You know, um... there's something that I wanted to ask you, and I don't really know how to say it so... here goes. Who's the crazy chick in the apron?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I got this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, hot-crazy scale?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Barney and I are not together. No. No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  College, good times."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, no, but I would love to buy one of them if... Where can I get one?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, there's nothing going on between me and Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I'm just saying you don't have anything to worry about."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I'm saying that you shouldn't be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about s*x, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You wanna hang out?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah man, you've been a rock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ok, how about Hurley's?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's that thing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The sea is blue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  She turns around."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Who is Gazeur?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You did what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Clearing the air, as before. Oh, man. It does not happen often. You are welcome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Who is Becca Delucci?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If the last person I wanted to see, came in I would not talk to him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My father."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have not spoken to him in 3 years and I want to start now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It goes back to my birth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He wanted a son and the fact that I am a girl has not changed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My full name is Robin Charles Scherbatsky, Jr. And it only got worse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  At 8, he took me hunting for the first time. I want to shoot a deer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But they're cute."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My body started to change..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was increasingly hard for him to act as if I was a boy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The worst moment came in my 14 years. My junior hockey team had just won the \"Squamish Invitational.\" And everybody came to my house to celebrate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're an idiot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And Kyle and I are doing anything serious. It was only the blue line."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that \"crease\" speaks for itself. After that, my relationship with my father has cooled. I moved with my mother, let my hair grow, was a Canadian pop star. Young normal stuff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what? \"I wish not to be raised as a boy, that thou teach me not to hunt, fish and smoke cigars and drinking scotch because girls do not do that. And you know why I run like a girl? Because I am one. \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is so exciting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I understand!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why take it away to bring him back in New Jersey, anyway?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Get rid of your demons!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, it's beautiful, Lily."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How do you play the harp with your belly so...?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You only play half the harp?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of \"Guitar Hero\"? Learned that in a day. Is there a \"Harp Hero\"?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? That didn't work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why? Why would she do that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That is a good song."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's Scooter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, wow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have hairy nipples."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, but it worked, didn't it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, no. Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are you sure?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, are you okay?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What happened to \"I don't want a perfect wedding\"?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's gonna cry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, I found your panties!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. First lie of marriage. That was fast."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not according to her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How is that a disaster?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Please, Cheese. You like this girl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, you can't say her name without smiling."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You like her. You should call her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good night. Good night, guys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Throw me one? Yeah."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I see what's going on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your shot. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nora met a guy. What?!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  In other words, one-eighth the size of Canada. So..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry. Who said anything about an...?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, \"Yeah, Barney, go get her!\" But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's a five, idiot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"Moon man language\"? What does that even mean?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look how you taped this up..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney. Go get her."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You say stuff pictures. Expect. You do not want it to look like a couple, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's so rude."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Totally. It is a tightrope, but still."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of course it was me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Funny. Every year my mother took tea with her friend Easter Bell. Not so funny."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It was there, we know the end."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The funny for this photo. I plottait ass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait. Look at these pictures. Barney always has the same pose and all these years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's gotta be a lousy picture of you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And in elementary school? We all have school pictures ugly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A crisp, Barney?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I! A photo ugly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This is what happened in Paris?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's terrible. My laptop is just... fell. You me collected?(Barney looks to pick it up) Mouse, m*therf*cker! I!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry, Ted. I agree with Lily on this. This kind of evening is hard for someone new. That's why I have not brought Don. When I was in Japan, this guy, hot date for our third, took me to his brother's wedding. Now I, a complete stranger, am on the photo album of the marriage of a Japanese couple forever."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm starting to cry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And you got me pinched cheeks very hard for them to be pink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And then we all ate chocolate cake in my bed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think Lori's age made him very wise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's a hole in your jacket?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  sh1t!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, Derek and I just broke up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks, I feel a lot better. Think I'll get that drink now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, makes sense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ooh, 'plus one', you make it sound so romantic. Ted: Fine. You wanna be my date?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Your date? I'd love to. Um, how fancy are we talking about here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I'll bring it. I'll bring it so hard the bride's gonna look like a big white bag of crap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, I need a dress."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know, it's a suicide mission."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (from inside apartment) Just a second."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, did I bring it? Or did I bring it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think I brought it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's what I was going for. I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're gonna have so much fun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted. Where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, OK, well I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's gonna love them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Bye-bye."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow yourself. Look who else brought it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello. Oh my God, tonight? You're kidding. Robin: (to Ted) They want me to anchor the news tonight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really? Like, anchor anchor? What happened to Sandy? OK, OK, sure, what time do you need me to...Right now! Oh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, I need like five minutes to change and um, I'll call you from the cab..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dibs on his wings!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, hey guys, hey Ranjit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nuh, it's scotch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hhhhh Don."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Now that's what I call having a woof over your head. Don. DON?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He asked me out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well we were on the air, I was on the spot, so I said OK."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? Nooo I HATE Don. And now I can't cancel because I said I would go out with him on the air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Getting drunk and cleaning the apartment was a plan?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh but we're not even like going out for dinner, we're just hanging out at his place."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it's not like that. It's just us and a bunch of other people."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Errrrrrr...I... OK."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Err, of course he asked me out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, he did. He did. He did. He DID!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whaaat?!! (in a high voice) (huffs) Nooo, I HATE Don! I-I-I can't stop thinking how much I hate him, it's like, it's like... all the time. I just wanna attack him and rip his stupid clothes off and spank him with his little paddle until his bum's all red. SHUT UP!! (leaves the table)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do not love Don."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah I got to agree. Duck's up, rabbit down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You wrap yourself in a comforter stuffed with rabbit hair. (almost yells) I wrap myself in one stuffed with duck feathers. Who's cosier? No, no, no, no, no, no... who's cosier?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Say it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  YAYYYYY."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you. And Don is, and always will be, a rabbit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Ted?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Before you go meet your future wife, why don't you swing by Don's party with me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, why?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They're not gonna get..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ha ha ha. It's not gonna get happen... but yeah, do that!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come... god, Don, what the hell are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, cause I would never, could like, standards, so... you know... I thought this was a party."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted's not my date. He's a friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (sees Don with imaginary rabbit's ears) You could say that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, this may hurt a little, I'm recycling your old Architecture Weekly magazines."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Cleaning. You go on your date. Happy Valentine's Day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You go on your date. Happy Valentine's Day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted! Come on. Big date."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know. So much running around and freaking out. For what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, the joke's on the rest of the world cause we can do that on our own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Exactly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Save it. Let's just do the news."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Clearly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  12."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You can... just look at your mug."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, I'll believe that when I see it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Don!! You're wearing pants!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (sees him with an imaginary duck's beak) Uh, duck!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Is your favorite brand of dental floss poisoning your entire family? Tune in at 11:00 for the shocking... Tooth."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, I officially hate my job. I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who shows up at night and scares people. I'm the bogeyman with a teleprompter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Coming up next, is your local ice cream man actually driving a roving meth lab on wheels? Stay tuned for the full... Scoop. Really?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You called, said..., and hung up. What do you want?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did you just ask me about about my period?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look, Barney, I'm at work right now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why are you acting like this?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're being super nice. It's... freaking me out. Be... gross, be inappropriate. Be Barney."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right. So I went to the chiropractor yesterday. That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Who are you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's not as easy..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I promise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  To taking chances."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, why not? Hold that thought?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  April, have... you met Barney? April just finished her shift, she's looking to blow off some steam."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You were so nice to me tonight, I wanted to return the favor, wingwoman-style. So, as I was saying, Barney is the Yankees' new second-baseman. And Barney, April asked if tomorrow, you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match. You can't make this stuff up. So, you two kids have fun."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney will take the envelope of cash I gave him and head straight into our trap."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Meanwhile, I'll make sure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry, Lily, but I have a chance to Don. And I will not drink out with you every night... especially when \"you\" included two of my ex."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You too. I gotta go. It is called? (She hangs up) Sorry, New York, I had to answer. Where were we? Bus accident."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry, someone had to. I pay my tour."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I don't know. Probably hanging out with Mike, this guy I've been seeing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I mean, he's not my boyfriend. He's just this guy I've been seeing for a couple of weeks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We're not really ready to go public yet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know, we were kinda thinking about staying at home and dressing up as naked people."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Ted, what are you doing for Halloween?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's the Slutty Pumpkin?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, how can a pumpkin costume be sexy?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, Chad, how's it hanging?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (to Barney as he walks by her out the door) Whoo."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (to Lily) Nice outfit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You sure are."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He's meeting me here. I ran late covering the Halloween parade in the Village. There are like a zillion gay pirates this year."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, you know, Mike and I joked about doing something together but we decided not to dress up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, geez."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ah, everyone, this is Michael. Th-that is not his real hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You thought I was...Oh, I was just kidding. I gotta stop making jokes in e-mails. It's so hard to convey tone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Actually I kinda need this hand to eat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This cheeseburger is so..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, well, that's good. I'm OK, thanks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm just really feeling this cheeseburger."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dude, I'm kind of in the zone here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, do you like Mike?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of course I do. Why?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ah, Lily, you know me, I'm just not into all that couple-y stuff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are you trying to get me to join a cult?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, what am I supposed to do? Buy him a giant teddy bear or something?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can share dessert. He better want the brownie sundae, but yeah, yeah, I can totally share."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A little to the left, Marshall. Lily, squat down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Got it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, this sundae looks so good I could eat the whole thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But, um, I would much rather share this small, one-scoop sundae with you, Mike."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, let's dig in, Mi... Mi... Microwave Oven."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, you found it. I came with you. Go on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I cannot get enough of it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm crazy and you're crazy for tiramisu."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, no, no, I mean it just sounds a little bit weird, doesn't it? We love tiramisu. Is it really a group activity, loving tiramisu? Right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  See there, hungry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, is that Gary Oldman? (pointing behind Mike and Marshall)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Brain freeze."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wanna drink the melty part?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, I thought we were gonna follow those bread crumbs back to my place, Hansel"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I like being with you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, who uses ink? Sorry. OK, I'm a bit set in my ways. That doesn't mean that this won't work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, are we breaking up?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Seriously it's not a big deal. He wanted to be a 'we,' and I wanted to be an 'I'. Dudes are such chicks. You guys, I'm fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You guys, let me get a picture."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I had a feeling I'd find you here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I never played any team sports"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I played tennis in high school. You know why? Because it was just me out there. I couldn't even stand playing doubles. I just got dumped."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, it's OK. I wasn't that into him. Story of my life. Everyone else is all falling in love and acting stupid and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me. Why don't I want that more? I want to want that. Am I wired wrong or something?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, what if I'm just a cold person? Tonight, Mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but I couldn't be Gretel. Why can't I be Gretel?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How do you do this, Ted? How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Scoot."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How many of those have you eaten?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Teddy boy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, here's what you do: Put together a care package of stuff from New York-- some H&H bagels, an Empire State Building keychain... and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready? From three days ago."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That is funny."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, fine, I have feelings for him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The irony is clear, Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, did she get the awesome care package yet?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Did she love it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So what's the problem?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Teddy boy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's pretty clear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Totally what I was thinking. Get out of my head, man!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I cut off all my fingers? Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it. I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident. I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'd wait."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi, Ted. It's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but, uh, do you want to come over?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My career. This is my new priority. From now on, more a date. The job."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My book? Buddy... in two volumes, right here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, I have told you, I take a break on that side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's unlikely, I focus on my career, finished the rencards."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's good but..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I answer? It's good for them..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's his life. These girls had it coming if they are stupid enough to be fooled."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  If you fall in there, you break my heart, but sorry, you're sdébile."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll fetch the newspaper."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You must stop, seriously. The last thing I'm looking for now is a relationship."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thousands?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What happened?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm leaving."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry to interrupt but check it out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I did not worship the book."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We just broke. The costumes are nice, but... it just broke."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's okay. It's hard for me too. Look at me. I gave up on relationships."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll knock your heads like two coconuts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's a good guy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It says what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I will not fall in love with him."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No comment. The blue jacket, it does not suit me, so..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I will work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm really going to work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn, Marshall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And here come the paramedics."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe she really does have a brain injury."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, yes, you do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Need a ride, cowboy?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hmm, too bad. I got candy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, come on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took \"highlights\" to mean, \"I want to look like a tiger,\" hence the hat."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, I'm 28. Hmm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I read that. More like \"Love in the Time of Don't Bothera.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We're not indoors. We're in a van."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Never. What else?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barf."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What else?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And she's looking to get married and have kids?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8:56. You're early."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And then there was Derek and counting you, that puts the total up to..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, I'm in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I just don't feel like going to a mall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I'm really not gonna go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'd rather not say."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let it go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let it go. And who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Ted: Not me in Ohio when I was nine, that's for sure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I used to be a dude."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A friend of mine in Canada got married way too young and it really turned her off to marriage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, I like it. Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada who got married too young? Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Field's giant cookie."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  There's no 'p' in husband."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Huh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are you asking me if I'm married? Ted: You can ask me. Nope, I'm not married. Your turn."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What happened to respecting my privacy? Ted: Just say, \"no, I'm not married.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, I don't understand why you can't..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thanks Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I say we just move on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Dusty rose and sienna."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes I was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How do you know?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What library?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  When did you go?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You told Marshall?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, but it could have been."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He moved there for business."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney, don't, okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I wanna stress that I was young."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And I didn't know any better."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And it started out as an innocent modeling job."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What the hell was that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  p0rn? I wish it was p0rn, it would be less embarrassing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I was a teenage pop star in Canada."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good call."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily! All we need is your indoor \"whoo.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Barney's awesome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We're just not feeling it right now. But we'll totally still be friends."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh no, no, no. God, no. Lily, it's not you. It's us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  OK, I should get going. I got a date."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Even better, seeing him naked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Slow your roll there, Lilypad."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ok, It's like this. After we kissed, we sat down to have the talk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We should figure out what this is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, now, we have to figure this out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, we knew you would say that. That's why we kept it a secret."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Euh, oh, hum, heu..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, Brad, that's... Wow, There's really six of them. But, I can't."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. No, no boyfriend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're probably wondering why I've been quiet all night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Damn it, Hordichuk! You miss another gimme like that, I'm gonna come down there and put a slapper right up your beerhole! Come on!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The truth is, I feel kind of weird being out with you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, Brad, no, it's..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  God, no... Brad, no... This is about me and Barney."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, we don't know what we are. I mean, my heart says \"leap into it.\" My brain says \"it's a bad idea.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Why not? Lay it on me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's putting it a bit strongly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We've been over this. Unless I say \"flugelhorn\" you haven't gone too far."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right. Look, don't even worry about it. It's..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  God. The doorknob's broken off. We're locked in here. Did, did you do this?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Flugelhorn. Did you do this?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (knocking at the door) Ted, are you out there?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, let us out of here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily! Come on. Let us out!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're gonna lock us in here? Well, guess what? Maybe we'll spend the whole day having s*x!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (from her room) Nice job, Ted."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not cool!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (to Barney) Dude, I'm starving. Let's... Let's just have the stupid talk. Come on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (reading) Where do you see this relationship going? My God, that sounds so cheesy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Totally. But hum... Where do you see this relationship going?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mad? I feel the same way. I suck at relationships. I mean, except with Ted. He really got it right. I know it's a cliché, but... he really ruined me for other men."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Maybe. But hum... I don't want to stop having s*x."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Friends isn't gonna work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know something we're good at."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No,not that. Lying. Think about it. We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends. Why not just keep lying?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really. We sat down. We had the talk. Barney's my boyfriend now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We're both afraid of commitment but... the fact is, we also can't live without each other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And he's awesome. He looks nice in a suit."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   He's my boyfriend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (leaving the building) She bought it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Totally. So, you want to get some breakfast?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, lead the way, sweetie pie."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"   Yeah, that felt wrong."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I was just so uptight in New York, you know? I mean, down here everybody shares everything. It's like we're all one big shimmering ball of positive energy. I wonder if anyone's ever thought that before."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A drum circle! They're different every time. Let's go watch!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And here I am at the drum circle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, it was. I feel like the Robin who left is not the same Robin who came back, you know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm evolved, and I'm enjoying living my life a little bit closer to the way Gael and I did in Argentina."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My journey was transformative and I reassert my commitment to both the aforementioned paramour and the philosophies he espouses.[\/b]"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mmm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. It's great. Amazing, fantastic, awesome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, now that I'm home, I'm finding myself getting annoyed at things that I loved on vacation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, so good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ooh sofa! Ooh sofa! Sofa, sofa, oh... ooh (she grunts)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ooh."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Laptop! Laptop! Laptop! (She sighs when the laptop fall over)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And you know what else? I'm still finding sand everywhere. I mean, we haven't been to the beach since Argentina. Where is all coming from?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But I don't want to. I was so happy down there. No, you know what? I'm done complaining. I'm evolving. Just gonna go with the flow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. Gael, you're peeing while I'm in the shower. Okay. Okay, old Robin would have been like, dude, ocupado. But now, you know what, I'm cool with it. Pee it up. In fact, when you're done, why won't you come in here and join me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Gael, there's some weird du.. (A lot of people is on her apartment) Hello."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Quick announcement. I am so glad that you're here, fellow travelers. A couple rules... not even rules. Let's call them guidelines for harmonious living. Guideline for harmonious living number one ; The kitchen sink is for dishes, the toilet is for pee-pee. G.F.H.L. number two ; Marijuana is illegal in the United States, even when baked into a blueberry muffin that someone might mistakenly eat for breakfast right before they leave for their job as a TV Newscaster. \"This just in: Look at my hand, how weird is my hand?\" is not an appropriate thing to say on the air. And number three... I... (All cherring). (Yelling) And number three is please keep the noise to a minimum. I have to take a nap. I'm still pretty baked."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Can you please keep it down?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well. I have to have a job."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm canadian. You know that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. I just realized something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, that you really suck. You're boring and lame and you're getting sand everywhere. Seriously, where is all the sand coming from? You're not the real me. All you are is me on vacation trying to get away from a break-up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, everyone out! I said everyone out!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  (yelling) I'm canadian!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I'm not. Listen, Gael, I need to talk to you about something."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, good to be back. Although it's weird, vacation Robin popped into my dream again last night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This time we went all the way. Tell you one thing. She is maybe sandy but that chick knows what I like."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We talk about a woman that Barney Stinson has worked. I vote for Narnia."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You call your mother every day?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's that, Barney?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Very good program."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You do not like playing the son of Barney?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know what it is. I am a presenter. But I had to accept a job on a morning show that starts at 4:30. I thought evolve much faster than that, you know? I'm almost 30 years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have not had surgery."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait. You wrote that we will have dinner?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What kind?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, Barney. You have no idea of the difficulty of getting a job beneath you. I really liked your tip on the bones of dinosaurs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Perfect. You see? Even in a role that you hate, you manage to love what you do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You think so?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you, Grant. You're pretty smart, you know that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The taxi is here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Who speaks it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have one. Terminator."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You hate me?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Push yourself. I recorded The View. This problem and was unemployed and sleeping on the couch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are not you aware? I am a presenter on CNN. And I have made gold a terrace overlooking Central Park. Get out of your ass's head, Marshall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, but you better not be as they stuck together when I cans on the roof. \"My ears. The neighbors called the cops.You almost hit me. \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Are you okay? You looked upset on the phone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, it's horrible!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what is huge? Marshall's head. It is as big as a watermelon in late August. Marshall's baby who is passing by?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A lot of things in the helmet of the space of 50 years who serves as its head."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I think it's just realistic."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Of course for you, it is natural, you're practically already a father."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, thoughtful. You go out jokes father of super lame."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You make us moral. Like when you broke your ship in a bottle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Shut up!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And you do that thing that all fathers are with the waitresses."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What? You're crazy. This is false."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I do not want to bite."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It comes down to one word: \"you\". Are you ready to put your dreams in the background? Back in college, taught art at the university? You have to concentrate on the project before starting Lily Baby Project. Otherwise, you'll regret it forever.And it would be good neither for you nor for the baby. What is it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, and everything I said?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And Marshall who works all the time?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But but Lily Project!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We had this debate, and this is the sock that makes you make the decision?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Shut up, Dad."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Babies are scary, OK? With their giant eyes. And seriously, the fontanelle? If there is a self-destruct button, at least, hide it where it will not accidentally press."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not a drop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That's why I have no children. We can not even taking his eyes for a second."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  They sit there with their stupid bottles. They cry. They vomit. That's why babies, it sucks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  My psychosis? Whenever you hear the word \"kid\", you have two small Milk tasks on your shirt."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Do not depict me as a monster for wanting to remain independent. In there is a lot of people who do not want it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'll see if the toilet. I also want to bring you back buffer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what? I should find another place to sleep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily is not there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  thank you God. What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I have a permit for that. And the other thing is a gift."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No. I do not know what she's doing there. It must have fallen into it. Bizarre!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Or Lily put it there for fun. That bitch is stuffed. I took it.It's just... so cute. Sock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I know. One day, perhaps. When I'm 70. Science will catch me. I'm just... I'm lost right now. I'm unemployed, I live on a couch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you, Ted. I have some ideas, so it will be one week, two large max."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Look at these guys, individually. These geniuses are not childless by choice, my friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Good night."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't even believe it myself."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  When was the last time you were there?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And why is that girl checking you out?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're going to the hospital?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ooh, can I do it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, why don't you just talk to him? He's your best friend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  A lemon law, like for cars."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Thank you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  It's a nice place. It's good to know the future has ribs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Just a second."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hello."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Leave me alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We're only just getting to know each other."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Sorry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I would never do that. I don't wanna go anywhere. I'm all yours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh God, I'll be right there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go. My friend's been stabbed with a sword."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, I swear that was a real call. I just...Oh forget it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Is she OK?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But you're totally..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily, your apartment makes the best Shanghai dumplings."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Aw."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yes, it is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi, Barney."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nothing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi. Have you met Barney?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Think he'll actually let it go?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Can I get a water please?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, God! Okay. Look, we have some... news."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's wrong?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, let's run some interference."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All right, let's get these two back to their table."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Conga line."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How's it go?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lame."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, so we're sitting there and the waiter comes over..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Um, we didn't order champagne."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Is an engagement ring."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Then whose is it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. That was hilarious. I was like... what? Anyway."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What the hell was what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I thought you were proposing to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, you know how I feel about marriage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Then why is this an issue?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So did you guys find anything to eat?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, don't do this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Where do you see yourself?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  And I probably want to be in Argentina."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah? And how did that work out for you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, come on, Ted, can you blame them?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Argentina."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, shut up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Aren't you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right? Right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, wait, wait, wait."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't know if I can do this to you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You know what I mean."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to start having babies right this second. Do you have a...?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, we probably shouldn't."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Risk it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Come on, they're cutting the cake."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again. That tuckered me out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Right. Okay, let me just go change, and we'll leave."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That is crazy. I have a change of clothes and you don't. Suck it up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. We were all talk, weren't we?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I don't want to have kids in Argentina."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  So where does that leave us?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You stole a blue French horn for me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Nope."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  We decided not to say anything till after the wedding."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  But we're okay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Well, uh, I've been to a couple funerals, so I know my role: I'm Vice Girl. Whatever Marshall needs to get through this day, I got it right here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, but doesn't Marshall's mom hate you--the fact that you two aren't very close?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Really, guys? At a funeral?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Outlet or USB?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  \"If\"? Ted, the kids in that movie jumped into a painting and spent 15 minutes chasing a cartoon fox. \"Spoonful of sugar...\"? Grow up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  All that stuff was really nice!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I've been known to locate certain objects from time to time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  I got ya."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  How?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  What's wrong?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You should listen to it. Just don't put too much pressure on it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  The point is, last words are overrated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You heard right. (whispering: ) I'm getting a reputation. So, what you need, mama? Come here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hey, stay hydrated."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  No, here's the awful part."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You remembered my birthday!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Whoa, they grow big out here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Judy, I..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Doesn't hold a candle to your Crocodile Dundee thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Hi, Dad."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Lily told you."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Girls talk about everything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Length, resemblance to a historical figure, such as Winston Churchill... Yes, that's one of you. Girth, grooming..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Duh. Of course there's a girl."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah, I-I think it is so cool that you started your own law firm."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  He said it's small, Marshall, and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Let's order!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Totally."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  You're acting like he has six months to live."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, come on! What about you men and your locker room talk?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Not to mention classy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Yeah. That argument has no traction whatsoever."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Uh, it looks disgusting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Oh, of course, because what woman doesn't like being slobbered on while some giant paws at her nether regions like Lenny from Of Mice and Men?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  More Cosmos?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow, that is weird."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  Wow. So he's right there making you say all this, huh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"  That sounds real."}
